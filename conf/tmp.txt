        <title>AM/FM BY CHRIS LIEBING</title>
        <link>http://www.chrisliebing.com</link>
        <description>Chris Liebing is a Techno pioneer, DJ, producer, radio host and the driving force behind CLR. He has been one of the first DJs who fully embraced the digital age of music and since then he has never stopped working on his DJ and production setup to find the most direct and dynamic form of sonic expression. For 2015 he and his growing team of like-minded artists are looking forward to a variety of exiting events and residencies worldwide.Still, I want to mention certain things during the show, but beyond that, I will provide additional info in form of a written set report, which can be found on chrisliebing.com or on Facebook.</description>

        <itunes:summary>Welcome to am/fm by Chris Liebing. This show is all about the music in the moment it was played. It kind of functions like an audible dj diary. The idea behind it is that I choose a recent set that I played and deliver it to you unedited, raw and direct, in 60 minutes pieces on a weekly basis. For example, if I play a three hours set somewhere, it will be divided in three 60 minutes long am/fm shows, so after three weeks you will have the full set. You could even put them into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I try to keep the commentaries to a minimum, so that you get a maximum amount of music. </itunes:summary>

It is quite a venue and considering that Belgium is a pretty small country, they have always had an amazing electronic music scene and therefor some of the best clubs in the world… and crowds. Thank you all for coming out that night, I hope you enjoyed the set.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Today´s AMFM has been recorded last month at the Ampere in Antwerp. Due to a little tour of five gigs at five different European locations on five consecutive days, which ended for Chris Liebing on Monday morning at Berghain / Berlin, we are a little late with the show this week and Chris has not had a chance to write a set report yet, but it will follow soon. Sorry for the delay, we are only human - and we still hope you enjoy the first part of this set.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM is the second and last part from my gig on the 21st of April in San Diego for @fngrscrssd at Bang Bang. I had never been to San Diego and already while I got out of the airport I noticed such a good vibe. It was warm, but not too warm, the sun was just setting and everyone seemed in a great mood. What a beautiful city. Since the plan was to drive back to Palm Springs for @coachella right after my set, my management had somehow decided to cancel the hotel. This caught me a little by surprise, but made me explore the historical city center for a couple of hours before my set. The actual location for the party at Bang Bang was this really beautiful, relatively simple rectangle room with a big disco-ball and a great sound. The vibe and atmosphere was so good that it made me chose the set for this AMFM and I wanna thank everyone involved for an amazing night. I can’t wait to be back. Hope you enjoy the show!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AMFM is the fourth and final hour of the set that I played at @soundnightclub in LA on February 10th 2018. I have been playing at this beautiful club in Hollywood twice before, but this night was so very special, that I really wanna share this 4h set with you. Not only this night was inspiring and loads of fun, but my entire 3 weeks long US, Mexico and Canada tour in February was like that, and I will not easily forget it for many reasons. 
<br />It is no secret that I love LA, the people, the vibe, the food, the cars and the nature, and in the past years I made many new friends there, especially with the @droidbehaviour crew around @drumcell, @deanpauldeleon and @audioinjection, as well as my beloved Venice beach crew and of course being able to meet and hang with amazing bands and artists such as @coldcave, adds to this incredible vibe. What made that 10th of February so extra-special, was that I was surrounded by my best friends who all happened to be in town for a couple of days. What do you want more… being in a city you love, surrounded by people you love and do the things you love… and all that even with a bit of a time off to enjoy and chill. It was truly a blessed time. Thank you all again for making that possible! 
<br />Now that you have all the four parts of the recording you could also put them together into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I hope you enjoy that ride.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AMFM is the first hour of the set that I played at @soundnightclub in LA on February 10th 2018. I have been playing at this beautiful club in Hollywood twice before, but this night was so very special, that I really wanna share this 4h set with you. Not only this night was inspiring and loads of fun, but my entire 3 weeks long US, Mexico and Canada tour in February was like that, and I will not easily forget it for many reasons. 
<br />It is no secret that I love LA, the people, the vibe, the food, the cars and the nature, and in the past years I made many new friends there, especially with the @droidbehaviour crew around @drumcell, @deanpauldeleon and @audioinjection, as well as my beloved Venice beach crew and of course being able to meet and hang with amazing bands and artists such as @coldcave, adds to this incredible vibe. What made that 10th of February so extra-special, was that I was surrounded by my best friends who all happened to be in town for a couple of days. What do you want more… being in a city you love, surrounded by people you love and do the things you love… and all that even with a bit of a time off to enjoy and chill. It was truly a blessed time. Thank you all again for making that possible! And btw., I will be back in LA for @coachella and will also be playing again at Sound Nightclub on Friday the 13th of April… so be there…
<br />Next week I will be posting the next hour of my set at Sound Nightclub and I hope you enjoy that ride.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This is the eighth and last hour of my set that I played at Robert Johnson in Offenbach on January 26th. I haven´t played in my hometown for nearly four years now and I was quite happy to be playing at Robert Johnson for the first time ever actually. I knew that this was most likely going to be a longer gig, but it went on even longer than I had anticipated. Confidns warmed up the place for me, I started to play at two and finished my set around eleven in the morning, after about nine hours of going through all kinds of music, new and old. It turned out to be an extremely fun night with good old friends around - and being able to go home in a taxi and to sleep in your own bed was quite a plus. The set is now eight hours long as I sadly had to edit out some unreleased music I was playing, tracks that will be out on my album, which is going to drop later this year. More information on that, of course you will find when I have it :) I hope you also enjoy the last hour of the set. It´s quite a long one, and for your listening pleasure I decided to drop the voiceovers in the middle of the individual one hour long pieces. Now that you have all the parts, you could actually put them into a playlist and listen to the whole set from the beginning to the end. It was a fantastic night, thanks to all people coming to my hometown to party!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This is the third and last part of my set that I played at HYTE NYE in the morning of January 1st at Funkhaus in Berlin. I played after Nina Kraviz who played a fabulous old-school, industrial Techno set, which suited this amazing location really well.

            <itunes:summary>This is the third and last part of my set that I played at HYTE NYE in the morning of January 1st at Funkhaus in Berlin. I played after Nina Kraviz who played a fabulous old-school, industrial Techno set, which suited this amazing location really well.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the end of the year and the beginning of a new one, I try to humbly state that I think I have something special for you. This week´s #AMFM is the recording of the second hour of the set that I played at Kompass Club in Gent on Friday, December 15, 2017. Maybe the best gig of the year, maybe so far in my career. Of course that is purely subjective, but playing felt so effortless and without much thinking in this insane industrial location with that amazing sound system. Sounds and beats just somehow flew together and all made sense. Being close to that beautiful crowd in the rather big hall made things become more and more one. Congrats to the sound, light and visual team btw, they all did a great job. There were so many trippy, jacking and other special moments, playing Jones and Stephenson in Belgium, being one of them (check the post that I did right after the gig). Everyone I talked to beforehand told me that I will have fun at Kompass Club. I had no clue how much it would be. All I can say is thanks to all involved for this night. Very special ...

<p>P.S.: And at last a thankful shout out to those guys who help me perform like this by making these amazing sounding products: 
<br />Native Instruments 
<br />Antelope Audio 
<br />Playdifferently 
<br />Allen and Heath</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This is the fifth and last hour of my set that I played at Museum Club in Buenos Aires. It was one gig out of 7 that I played in a 10 days tour through South America, most likely my best South America tour so far. It took me to Paraguay and Uruguay, two countries I haven´t been before, as well as Brazil and of course Argentina. Buenos Aires was as always on fire. Can’t believe how lucky I am having such support in this beautiful City. The night at Museum Club was no exception and I ended up having an amazing, wild and trippy 5 h ride. Hope you enjoy, which I believe is a good look into how the rest of the tour was musically.”]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On September 30th 2017 I played a 4h set at the beautiful Spazio 900 in Roma. It was part of a beautiful Italian weekend that had started with a super-fun night at Dude Club Milan on Friday. There are nights when just everything flows together amazingly well. I had some new tracks that somehow fit into the vibe of that night so well, that it made it even more special to play at this amazing venue, where I have spent already quite a few good nights. That´s why I wanted you to relive this set again. Some of you might have noticed, that not only because of using my new Native Instruments Maschine MK3, I changed a little bit the way I play. Not so much musically, but technically, with more dynamics, resulting in a different vibe. Well, maybe you notice… and even if not, I hope you enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed playing. In my opinion it´s one of the best sets that I ever got to play there…. Italia is amazing and I thank you all for the constant love and passion that I get to experience there. Grazie Mille!]]></description>

In my opinion it´s one of the best sets that I ever got to play there…. Italia is amazing and I thank you all for the constant love and passion that I get to experience there. Grazie Mille!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s #AMFM is the fourth and last part of the set that I played at Pacha Barcelona on September 10th, a Sunday night. Of what I heard, the busiest Sunday ever so far at Pacha Barcelona. Well, let´s not gimme the whole credit for that (although my DJ ego would love that), there also was a public bank holiday on Monday … still - what a crowd and what a vibe! Flug played a great opening set and I think I could have gone on for hours and hours to be honest. Anyways, in the end it was a 4,5h set and now that you have all of the parts you could also put it together into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Barcelona rocks! Muchas Gracias!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s #AMFM is the fourth and last hour of my set that I played on August the 12th at Sunny Beach, a Bulgarian beach on the Black Sea… Well the actual venue is called Cacao Beach, quite a beautiful place with an amazing sunrise in the morning. It had been a pretty intense, fun and long day before we headed out to Bulgaria, cause it was on the same day of the great Swiss Streetparade in Zürich where I played on a float with @dice. A fun day, but also a little demanding with regard to sleep and activity. The plan was to play 5h at Cacao Beach, from 2-7 am, so into the sunrise. Shortly after we got to the venue, the promoter told us, that the government is regularly checking the sound levels of all places on the beach and that I had to play at around 90 dB for the most part. For those of you not familiar with levels, in a club it is relatively normal to have about 100-120 dB. So when I started a little delayed (this is why the whole set is only about 4h and 40min long) I tried to make the best out of it and luckily the crowd was very understanding and we ended up having a real good night/morning. Well you can judge yourself by checking out the set. Now that you have all the four parts you could even put them together into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. One major reason for me to upload the set to #AMFM was, that those who were there should be able to have the opportunity to listen again… and loud… enjoy..]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s #AMFM is the second hour of my set that I played on August the 12th at Sunny Beach, a Bulgarian beach on the Black Sea… Well the actual venue is called Cacao Beach, quite a beautiful place with an amazing sunrise in the morning. It had been a pretty intense, fun and long day before we headed out to Bulgaria, cause it was on the same day of the great Swiss Streetparade in Zürich where I played on a float with Loco Dice. A fun day, but also a little demanding with regard to sleep and activity. The plan was to play 5h at Cacao Beach, from 2-7 am, so into the sunrise. Shortly after we got to the venue, the promoter told us, that the government is regularly checking the sound levels of all places on the beach and that I had to play at around 90 dB for the most part. For those of you not familiar with levels, in a club it is relatively normal to have about 100-120 dB. So when I started a little delayed (this is why the whole set is only about 4h and 40min long) I tried to make the best out of it and luckily the crowd was very understanding and we ended up having a real good night/morning. Well you can judge yourself by checking out the set. One major reason for me to upload the set to #AMFM was, that those who were there should be able to have the opportunity to listen again… and loud… enjoy..</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s #AMFM is the third and last hour of my set at Guendalina club in the south of Italy on July 29th 2017. For about 15 years now I have had the pleasure to play on a regular basis in Italy, but never played at that beautiful open air club before. For me this Saturday, July 29th, had 3 gigs planned. I started at the playdifferent stage at Tomorrowland and afterwards I flew directly to Stuttgart airport, where they sadly had some repairs on the runway, which caused some heavy delays, making me miss my gig at the @wetfestival. Things like this can happen and are beyond anyone´s control, yet they are really frustrating, not only for me, also I believe for all of the people waiting at the event. Luckily my good friend Dubfire was willing to fill in and what I heard he smashed it. After all, the trip continued and I arrived a little late, but very psyched to play at Guendalina. And what a good time we had, what a beautiful place and what an amazing crowd. South of Italy never disappoints in the summer. I am so blessed and thankful for these moments. Grazie Mille once more. For those of you who glue the weekly AMFM hours together, I need to tell you that due to the fact that my set was just a little short of 3h, I needed to overlap the 2nd and the 3rd hour to make it fit for three shows. So if you really wanna fit it together, be aware that the first 15 min of the 3rd hour are the same as the last 15 min of the 2nd hour. Sorry for this inconvenience, but I couldn’t find any other way. Hope you will enjoy the set as much as I did playing it …]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AMFM is the second hour of my 2h set at the Movement Festival in Detroit. The memorial day weekend in the States has been since many years now the weekend when the techno world travels to Detroit. It has always been a very special date in my calendar for many reasons and it also is the time of year when the summer season is upon us. This year I had the pleasure to close the Pyramid stage on the last day of the festival. The weather was warm, but a bit cloudy with chances of wind and rain. Which id did. Not too long into my set. Not only rain, also stormy winds that almost blew my equipment away. The amazing stage crew managed to keep stuff dry, holding plastic covers over me. Somehow everything that was happening did not disturb me at all, it became actually more fun. As it started raining I played my little edit of Josh Wink’s track “Resist” and told the one stage manager who was trying to keep everything dry, that the rain will stop as soon as the track is over. Funny that it then happened that way. You might hear it on the recording. I wanna thank the audience for not running from the weather, but rather kept partying even harder, the wetter it got. You sometimes throw around the phrase “this was magic”... but those were magic moments indeed, having the Detroit sykline behind you, looking over the Detroit River, this amazing crowd and fun with the weather. I really enjoyed that set and I am happy to present it here, so you can relive it, in case you were there, or check it out in case you weren’t. In any case, I hope you enjoy it. 
<br />And thanks again to the whole Paxahau crew, who produces this amazing festival. Been sleeping in their basement back in 2000 and so happy to see what they are achieving. Love you all!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM is the ninth and last hour and a half of a 9.5h set that I played at Concrete in Paris on May 7th 2017. The French Techno scene has had a revival as big as I haven’t really seen it before in any other countries. Since about 5-6 years France has managed to really come back into the circle of countries where Techno and House music play a major cultural role. By now there are many amazing events and clubs all over France and one major driver of that scene and one of the places to be, is the club Concrete in Paris. This is not the first podcast of mine that comes out of this beautiful club on a boat on the river Seine. I have been playing Concrete regularly in the past years and enjoyed every minute of it. I also played many all night long gigs, but nothing like this one beginning of May. Now that the club has a license to stay open longer, I was told a week before, that I could play till 9:30 in the morning if I wanted to, starting of course at midnight, when the main floor opens. Besides the fact that I love playing opening sets (you will see me doing this for HYTE in Ibiza a couple of times again in the main room of Amnesia this summer), it is something special at Concrete. Once the doors open, it only takes about 10-20 min, till the place is packed, so not much time to fool around in the beginning, but also not to smash it right away, since you know you have another 9h to go. Playing those long sets is always an adventure, you never know where you end up and you are subject to many different factors. I did prepare a little more than usual for this gig, so I picked some special old goodies and had them in mind to drop them here and there. Let´s see if you can spot them. This night, I must say, went incredibly well, but that is not only due to the nice staff and promoters, it is mostly thanks to that open minded beautiful audience, that is willing to join you on a journey through the night - as cheesy that might sound now - but that ´s what it is. So I hope you enjoy this long ride right here on AMFM in the next weeks. Remember, you get one hour each week and after 9 weeks, you will have the whole set, with only little of my talking, as I give you most info here in my set report. I wanna thank the Paris Clubbers again for pushing me through such a long night with such a great vibe. Concrete rocks and I can’t wait to be back. Now that you have all the parts of the set you could even put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole thing with seamless transitions. Comments always welcome :) Enjoy!]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s AMFM is the ninth and last hour and a half of a 9.5h set that I played at Concrete in Paris on May 7th 2017. The French Techno scene has had a revival as big as I haven’t really seen it before in any other countries. Since about 5-6 years France has managed to really come back into the circle of countries where Techno and House music play a major cultural role. By now there are many amazing events and clubs all over France and one major driver of that scene and one of the places to be, is the club Concrete in Paris. This is not the first podcast of mine that comes out of this beautiful club on a boat on the river Seine. I have been playing Concrete regularly in the past years and enjoyed every minute of it. I also played many all night long gigs, but nothing like this one beginning of May. Now that the club has a license to stay open longer, I was told a week before, that I could play till 9:30 in the morning if I wanted to, starting of course at midnight, when the main floor opens. Besides the fact that I love playing opening sets (you will see me doing this for HYTE in Ibiza a couple of times again in the main room of Amnesia this summer), it is something special at Concrete. Once the doors open, it only takes about 10-20 min, till the place is packed, so not much time to fool around in the beginning, but also not to smash it right away, since you know you have another 9h to go. Playing those long sets is always an adventure, you never know where you end up and you are subject to many different factors. I did prepare a little more than usual for this gig, so I picked some special old goodies and had them in mind to drop them here and there. Let´s see if you can spot them. This night, I must say, went incredibly well, but that is not only due to the nice staff and promoters, it is mostly thanks to that open minded beautiful audience, that is willing to join you on a journey through the night - as cheesy that might sound now - but that ´s what it is. So I hope you enjoy this long ride right here on AMFM in the next weeks. Remember, you get one hour each week and after 9 weeks, you will have the whole set, with only little of my talking, as I give you most info here in my set report. I wanna thank the Paris Clubbers again for pushing me through such a long night with such a great vibe. Concrete rocks and I can’t wait to be back. Now that you have all the parts of the set you could even put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole thing with seamless transitions. Comments always welcome :) Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

I did prepare a little more than usual for this gig, so I picked some special old goodies and had them in mind to drop them here and there. Let´s see if you can spot them. This night, I must say, went incredibly well, but that is not only due to the nice staff and promoters, it is mostly thanks to that open minded beautiful audience, that is willing to join you on a journey through the night - as cheesy that might sound now - but that ´s what it is. So I hope you enjoy this long ride right here on AMFM in the next weeks. Remember, you get one hour each week and after 9 weeks, you will have the whole set, with only little of my talking, as I give you most info here in my set report. I wanna thank the Paris Clubbers again for pushing me through such a long night with such a great vibe. Concrete rocks and I can’t wait to be back. Comments always welcome :) Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM is the third hour of a 9.5h set that I played at Concrete in Paris on May 7th 2017. The French Techno Scene has had a revival as big as I haven’t really seen it before in any other countries. Since about 5-6 years France has managed to really come back into the circle of countries where Techno and House music play a major cultural role. By now there are many amazing events and clubs all over France and one major driver of that scene and one of the places to be, is the club Concrete in Paris. This is not the first podcast of mine that comes out of this beautiful club on a boat on the river Seine. I have been playing Concrete regularly in the past years and enjoyed every minute of it. I also played many all night long gigs, but nothing like this one beginning of May. Now that the club has a license to stay open longer, I was told a week before, that I could play till 9:30 in the morning if I wanted to, starting of course at midnight, when the main floor opens. Besides the fact that I love playing opening sets (you will see me doing this for HYTE in Ibiza a couple of times again in the main room of Amnesia this summer), it is something special at Concrete.

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM is the fifth and last hour of my five hours set that I played at Block Club in Tel Aviv on March 30th. I had never been to this club before, but heard many good things about it, especially about the owner´s passion about the sound system. Actually part of the reason why I had never played there before was, that the club had an installed special mixer, that every DJ had to use. At that time I was using the XONE 92 from Alland & Heath and since I view my setup as some kind of instrument in which the mixer is a vital component, playing on a different type of mixer was always out of the question for me. That changed with the playdifferently Model 1 Mixer, as this is now the only other mixer that the owner of Block would allow to be used on his sound system. You just gotta love such passionate people. There are quite a few club owners out there who are proud of their sound systems, but rarely all the talk really lives up to the reality (ok, I admit, I am very picky with sound systems). Not so in Tel Aviv, the sound in the whole club, not only on the main dance floor, was really amazing. But more important for me (selfish DJ that I am), the monitor system in the booth was one of the most detailed and crisp sounding one I have ever played on. And I have played on a few. Did I mention that not only the sound system at Block is one of its kind, also the design of the club… and what’s even more important, the whole crew is super nice too. Consequently the DJing is a lot more fun and you can go a lot deeper into sound, which made me end up playing for 5h. And that was a great ride. Now you have all the five parts and could put them together in a playlist to listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I wanna thank you all in Tel Aviv again for that great night. I hope you enjoy the recording. Comments are always welcome!]]></description>

The club is called Underground, since.. well it is kind of in the basement. A great location with a proper sound system is sometimes all you need. There is not really much to say about that gig other than it was loads of fun and the vibe was great. Sometimes there is just not much more to it, just enjoying playing the music. So I do hope you can enjoy listening to it now :) Looking forward to be back … next week you will find the third and final hour of the set.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM show is the last hour and 45 minutes of my set that I played in Teramo Italy at the Warehouse Alternative Club (https://www.facebook.com/warehousealternativeclub). It was the fourth gig in a row on a weekend that already started on Thursday in Moscow with a Boiler Room show, that you can actually re-watch on my facebook page. Friday I headed back to Germany, to play two clubs in one night, the Bootshaus in Cologne and later the good old Butan Club in Wuppertal till early in the morning. Since travelling to Teramo is not the easiest thing (not really any major airport anywhere near), we were flying from Düsseldorf to Rome and had another 3h car ride, to finally arrive at the Warehouse on Saturday night. So kind of tired and also still jetlagged from my 3 weeks in the states before, you sometimes are not sure how a gig will turn out, but the energy in Teramo even made me play longer in the end and I had again a fantastic time in one of my favorite countries ever. I hope you enjoy listening to the set as much as I had fun playing it. Now you could also put all four parts into a playlist and listen to the whole thing with seamless transitions. Thanks to the best fans in the world, you always push me to give it all…]]></description>

I wanna thank you all in Tel Aviv again for that great night. I hope you enjoy the recording. Comments are always welcome!]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s AMFM is the fourth hour of my five hours set that I played at Block Club in Tel Aviv on March 30th. I had never been to this club before, but heard many good things about it, especially about the owner´s passion about the sound system. Actually part of the reason why I had never played there before was, that the club had an installed special mixer, that every DJ had to use. At that time I was using the XONE 92 from Allen &amp; Heath and since I view my setup as some kind of instrument in which the mixer is a vital component, playing on a different type of mixer was always out of the question for me. That changed with the Playdifferently Model 1 Mixer, as this is now the only other mixer that the owner of Block would allow to be used on his sound system. You just gotta love such passionate people. There are quite a few club owners out there who are proud of their sound systems, but rarely all the talk really lives up to the reality (ok, I admit, I am very picky with sound systems). Not so in Tel Aviv, the sound in the whole club, not only on the main dance floor, was really amazing. But more important for me (selfish DJ that I am), the monitor system in the booth was one of the most detailed and crisp sounding one I have ever played on. And I have played on a few.

The club is called Underground, since.. well it is kind of in the basement. A great location with a proper sound system is sometimes all you need. There is not really much to say about that gig other than it was loads of fun and the vibe was great. Sometimes there is just not much more to it, just enjoying playing the music. So I do hope you can enjoy listening to it now :) Looking forward to be back with a new show next week … and now that you have all the three parts of this gig, you could also put them together into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM show is the third hour of my set that I played in Teramo Italy at the Warehouse Alternative Club (https://www.facebook.com/warehousealternativeclub). It was the fourth gig in a row on a weekend that already started on Thursday in Moscow with a Boiler room show, that you can actually re-watch on my facebook page. Friday I headed back to Germany, to play two clubs in one night, the Bootshaus in Cologne and later the good old Butan Club in Wuppertal till early in the morning. Since travelling to Teramo is not the easiest thing (not really any major airport anywhere near), we were flying from Düsseldorf to Rome and had another 3h car ride, to finally arrive at the Warehouse on Saturday night. So kind of tired and also still jetlagged from my 3 weeks in the states before, you sometimes are not sure how a gig will turn out, but the energy in Teramo even made me play longer in the end and I had again a fantastic time in one of my favorite countries ever. I hope you enjoy listening to the set as much as I had fun playing it. Thanks to the best fans in the world, you always push me to give it all…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AMFM is the third hour of my set that I played at Beta Nightclub in Denver Colorado on Sunday, January 22nd. It was my first US weekend in 2017 and that Friday night I played at the new Schimanski club in Brooklyn. For those who don’t know, the club is named after a famous German TV character, a police detective who was always known for his rough and rebellious style. It was quite a night in that way as well. Without much sleep I flew to Montreal, where I played Igloo Fest on Saturday night, closing the main stage around midnight. What a festival. An Open Air in the middle of the Canadian winter. Then catching the only direct flight to Denver at 7 in the morning. We started to feel the lack of sleep a little by then. So after a good bit of sleep we arrived at @Beta around 9:30. The Sundays there are quite special, due to the fact that you have quite a dedicated crowd of people who come out for an early night. The plan was to play till midnight, but we ended up extending it 2h longer. I thought no one minded. So for an early Sunday evening, it turned out to be quite a ride. So much energy in that room, I somehow ended up playing some new stuff mixed up with my personal old favs from last year and before. No rules, even quite rebellious at times ;) Well let´s have a listen. I hope you enjoy these four hours of Denver.]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s AMFM is the third hour of my set that I played at Beta Nightclub in Denver Colorado on Sunday, January 22nd. It was my first US weekend in 2017 and that Friday night I played at the new Schimanski club in Brooklyn. For those who don’t know, the club is named after a famous German TV character, a police detective who was always known for his rough and rebellious style. It was quite a night in that way as well. Without much sleep I flew to Montreal, where I played Igloo Fest on Saturday night, closing the main stage around midnight. What a festival. An Open Air in the middle of the Canadian winter. Then catching the only direct flight to Denver at 7 in the morning. We started to feel the lack of sleep a little by then. So after a good bit of sleep we arrived at @Beta around 9:30. The Sundays there are quite special, due to the fact that you have quite a dedicated crowd of people who come out for an early night.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! Can I still say that? Had a discussion earlier about how long you can actually say Happy New Year. Anyways, this week´s AMFM is the second hour of the set that I played on January 1st 2017 at the beautiful Gashouder in Amsterdam for Awakenings. After playing in Rome and Berlin on the night/morning before, I could not ask for a better start into the new year, covering these 3 amazing cities and events. The first of those was Spazio 900 in Rome, where I had the honour to DJ while slipping into the new year with my great friends and fans in Italy. After that we took off directly to Berlin, where I had the pleasure to finish the main floor of the extremely amazing HYTE NYE event.
<br />After a few hours of rest we then took off to Amsterdam in the evening of the 1st for the great Gashouder. If you have never been, you should go. Awakenings is throwing the best parties in there and this time was somehow even more energetic than last time. So I decided to release the set. Although both others were equally fun, I find this one captures that NYE ride and vibe quite well. I hope you enjoy it!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM show is the fourth and last hour of my set that I played at the Nextech Festival in beautiful Florence. The venue is a historical place in the center of the city, called Fortezza da Basso. First time I played there was 2002, back then actually for the same promoter. Isn’t it amazing how we manage in this ever-changing world to have places in the Techno scene where some things don’t change and rather develop in a great way over the years? Also amazing was the fact that this year´s event, which happened on December 7th, was sold out beforehand, in spite of the fact that it is actually a rather big venue. I just love Italy :). Maybe you wanna check out the after movie on their Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/nextechfestival/videos/ . 
<br />This time I played a 4h set. Doing this in front of such a large crowd can sometimes be a little intimidating, but not in Florence, not in Italy. The passion and love of the crowd just pushes you to different levels (thank you all again). This paired with an amazing sound system and a sound crew, which consists of true professionals, (another big thanks from my side) is the key to be in a flow that enables you at times to create something special and unique (at least I had the feeling that this was happening in my little world on the stage). Additionally I may add, that playing with my Model One Mixer by PLAYdifferently and running all my sounds through my unbeatable, super tight and stable Antelope Audio Orion 32+ Sound interface creates the best sound that I have ever experienced. I wonder if some of you can spot the difference in sound since I have been using this new setup from about August of this year on, by comparing it with older sets (good thing about AM/FM is that you can go back in time - as I said, it is kind of a musical diary). Also I am becoming more and more familiar with my new Maschine Jam and Maschine Mikro combination by Native Instruments. The more I work with it, the more fun I am having.
<br />Well, I hope you are having fun too and enjoy listening to the set as much as I had playing it. Now that you have all the four parts you could also put them together into a playlist and listen to the entire set with seamless transitions.</p>]]></description>

The passion and love of the crowd just pushes you to different levels (thank you all again). This paired with an amazing sound system and a sound crew, which consists of true professionals, (another big thanks from my side) is the key to be in a flow that enables you at times to create something special and unique (at least I had the feeling that this was happening in my little world on the stage). Additionally I may add, that playing with my Model One Mixer by PLAYdifferently and running all my sounds through my unbeatable, super tight and stable Antelope Audio Orion 32+ Sound interface creates the best sound that I have ever experienced. I wonder if some of you can spot the difference in sound since I have been using this new setup from about August of this year on, by comparing it with older sets (good thing about AM/FM is that you can go back in time - as I said, it is kind of a musical diary). Also I am becoming more and more familiar with my new Maschine Jam and Maschine Mikro combination by Native Instruments. The more I work with it, the more fun I am having.
<br />Well, I hope you are having fun too and enjoy listening to the set as much as I had playing it. Next week you will be able to get the 3rd hour of it. Until then I wish you all some great holidays and a great start in the new year!</p>]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s AM/FM show is the second hour of my set that I played at the Nextech Festival in beautiful Florence. The venue is a historical place in the center of the city, called Fortezza da Basso. First time I played there was 2002, back then actually for the same promoter. Isn’t it amazing how we manage in this ever-changing world to have places in the Techno scene where some things don’t change and rather develop in a great way over the years? Also amazing was the fact that this year´s event, which happened on December 7th, was sold out beforehand, in spite of the fact that it is actually a rather big venue. I just love Italy :).

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s episode contains the last hour and a half of our Collabs set at Amsterdam Dance Event at Warehouse Elementenstraat for HYTE on October 22nd. Speedy J and I started around 11:30 pm and played for about 8,5h. So much for the dry facts. This year´s ADE collided with the fall break of German schools. Some of you might know I am a daddy and I like to take my kids on fun trips during their school breaks. So this year we went to Los Angeles. When I booked everything I wasn´t aware that ADE would be at the same time, so I had to plan accordingly, since I didn´t wanna miss my annual Saturday night gig for HYTE.
<br />My travel schedule is pretty crazy at times, but something like this even I haven´t done before. I left LA on Friday night, flew to Amsterdam via Zürich and went back Sunday morning at 9 the same way, meaning right after the gig. I didn´t even need a hotel. Ok, some of you might think now that flying around the world for one gig is not exactly eco friendly. I know that. But as a vegan, I can assure you, I make up for that CO2 footprint easily, but that is another topic.
<br />When I arrived in Amsterdam, the first thing I had to do was a photo shoot for Mixmag, who are doing a special on the PLAYdifferently mixers (look out for that issue in December), then it was off to the venue where Speedy J was already waiting and ready to go.
<br />We never really plan our sets, but we kind of discuss how we wanna start out. Jochem and I agreed on going all in, as the venue was already quite busy and we (due to my slightly delayed arrival) kind of 30 minutes overdue. Now normally I shouldn´t say that, cause it is not really motivating for you listeners, but it took us about 1,5h to find our groove and get into things. So the set got better and better during the night, at least that is how we felt about it. That means that I would have rather used the set from 2h in, but I kept my promise at AM/FM and offer you the unedited set, the way it was played. So in case you didn´t like the first hour and a half, it should be better by now. And maybe I am also just too much of my own critic... well you decide for yourself.
<br />All in all I can say that this whole night was something special. Jochem and I had an amazing time playing and it was a real fantastic crowd that stuck with us from the beginning to the end. Smiles all over. Also thanks to HYTE, for that perfect organization once again. This is how parties should be. So yes, flying in and out from LA for this gig was 100 times worth it and I would always do it again. Thank you all for letting me do this. And now that you have all the individual parts of the set you could put them together into a playlist and listen to the whole eight and a half hours with seamless transitions. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

So the set got better and better during the night, at least that is how we felt about it. That means that I would have rather used the set from 2h in, but I kept my promise at AM/FM and offer you the unedited set, the way it was played. So in case you didn´t like the first hour and a half, it should be better by now. And maybe I am also just too much of my own critic... well you decide for yourself.
All in all I can say that this whole night was something special. Jochem and I had an amazing time playing and it was a real fantastic crowd that stuck with us from the beginning to the end. Smiles all over. Also thanks to HYTE, for that perfect organization once again. This is how parties should be. So yes, flying in and out from LA for this gig was 100 times worth it and I would always do it again. Thank you all for letting me do this. Next week you will find the sixth hour of our set….and remember, it always gets better…</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s episode is the fourth hour of our Collabs set at Amsterdam Dance Event at Warehouse Elementenstraat for Hyte on October 22nd. Speedy J and I started around 11:30 pm and played for about 8,5h. So much for the dry facts. This year´s ADE collided with the fall break of German schools. Some of you might know I am a daddy and I like to take my kids on fun trips during their school breaks. So this year we went to Los Angeles. When I booked everything I wasn´t aware that ADE would be at the same time, so I had to plan accordingly, since I didn´t wanna miss my annual Saturday night gig for Hyte.
<br />My travel schedule is pretty crazy at times, but something like this even I haven´t done before. I left LA on Friday night, flew to Amsterdam via Zürich and went back Sunday morning at 9 the same way, meaning right after the gig. I didn´t even need a hotel. Ok, some of you might think now that flying around the world for one gig is not exactly eco friendly. I know that. But as a vegan, I can assure you, I make up for that CO2 footprint easily, but that is another topic.
<br />When I arrived in Amsterdam, the first thing I had to do was a photo shoot for Mixmag, who are doing a special on the PLAYdifferently mixers (look out for that issue in December), then it was off to the venue where Speedy J was already waiting and ready to go.
<br />We never really plan our sets, but we kind of discuss how we wanna start out.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the second and last hour of my set that I played at Instytut Warsaw on September 30th 2016. Like I have mentioned before I updated my setup over the course of the last two months. Next to my playdifferently Model one mixer that I have been using since March, I play the music now through an antelopeaudio Orion 32+ soundcard, and I heard that some of you even notice a much improved sound to earlier sets. My latest addition though is the Machine Jam from Native Instruments and I am slowly finding my way with it. So this time I took my equipment to Warsaw to play at quite a spectacular venue, called the Instytut. It is a huge kind of industrial building, which is used for electrical experiments. You should check out the website here: 
<br />https://www.technoinstytut.pl/
<br />Marcel Dettmann was playing an amazing and intense techo set before me, so after playing a bit more on the softer edge over the summer I thought it is the right time and place for some more techno, including the use of my new Maschine. I hope you enjoy the music. I definitely enjoyed making it. Thanks everyone again in Warsaw for that great night!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the first hour of my set that I played at Instytut Warsaw on September 30th 2016. Like I have mentioned before I updated my setup over the course of the last two months. Next to my PLAYdifferently Model one mixer that I have been using since March, I play the music now through an Antelope Audio Orion 32+ soundcard, and I heard that some of you even notice a much improved sound to earlier sets. My latest addition though is the Machine Jam from Native Instruments and I am slowly finding my way with it. So this time I took my equipment to Warsaw to play at quite a spectacular venue, called the Instytut. It is a huge kind of industrial building, which is used for electrical experiments.

            <description><![CDATA[Sometimes time flies faster when having fun and somehow that applies to this summer. Is it already beginning of October? It has been an amazing ride and an intense tour schedule for me lately, and as you might remember from the set report of the first part of this recording, I sometimes even had difficulties to keep up with the delivery of my radio shows. But still, so far it has always worked out on time, also this week again, so here comes the third part of the recording of my set that I recently played at Flash Factory in NYC. It´s no secret that I love NYC and also this time I could rely on the great crowd in that city. Also I wanna mention that it was only the second set (Flash DC being the first) with my new setup. Especially the new Maschine Jam brings a whole new aspect to the sound, so does my soundcard from Antelope_Audio. Well, of course there is much room to improve my skills with the new Maschine, but I am quite happy with how it works so far, even though there is much more potential. Anyways, some of you might hear the difference, even though, yes, I agree, it is still some of the same tracks. Funny is that I still very much enjoy to play them. I also think some of the tracks that I play a lot, I understand better and better, so that I can mix them up with different stuff again and again. Well, the gig at Flash Factory in New York was special for many reasons, so I hope you also enjoy listening to the third and last hour of that set from September 16th.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Sometimes time flies faster when having fun and somehow that applies to this summer. Is it already middle of September? I am currently on a little weekend tour in the US. Played Thursday night in Washington DC at Flash, which again was quite a start of the weekend. So feeling Friday on my way to NYC as I would normally do Sunday nights, I realised that I didn’t prepare a new AMFM show for coming Monday. Usually I am quite organised, thanks to Benny’s help, who perfectly takes care of the podcast since the beginning of the CLR Podcast days, but somehow I thought there is at least another week until I need a new set. Well, it turned out that there isn’t. So here is now, what I think is definitely one of the freshest shows so far, as it is the recording of my set from last night at Flash Factory in NYC. It´s no secret that I love NYC and also this time I could rely on the great crowd in that city. Also I wanna mention that it was only the second set (Flash DC being the first) with my new setup.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s episode is the third and last hour of my set that I played for HYTE at Amnesia on August 24th. HYTE on Ibiza has been going strong in its second season and was loads of fun so far. Yet this night was for me one of the best ones. Maybe because Radio Slave and Henrik Schwarz laid down fantastic sets before me or the crowd was just totally into it…. or .. most likely both.
<br />It is end of August and I guess you can ask any DJs out there if they start to musically repeat themselves during this month. August is usually not the time when loads of new stuff is released and promos are send out, as everyone has no time to check and listen anyways, cause you are either on holiday and partying or working and DJing 20-30 gigs per month, or all of it together. But I have to say, although I repeat myself here and there, there is always some new stuff that makes you play everything a little differently … especially with my Playdifferently Model One Mixer. Not only that. I used the beginning of last week to change my setup from ground up, from now on using my new Antelope Orion 32+ soundcard with only one computer, having less cables but still at least the same or even more possibilities than before. Already changing that is exciting. I played my first two gigs at the wonderful Sonus Festival in Croatia and besides some minor mistakes, hitting the wrong knobs here and there, everything was very stable and sounded great. So Amnesia on Wednesday was my third gig with it and if you have been following my sets lately you might be able to hear the difference. Ok, enough for now, enjoy and listen and I will go record shopping, as it is September now :). If one of you have some set related or technical questions, ask, I will do my best to answer all of them in the comments. And remember, now that you have all the three separate parts, you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Summer! Loco Dice and I were booked to play on the Hyte and Beach Love Mobile at the street Parade 2016. We had no idea what a blast that would be. First of all, what an honor it was for us to perform on the leading truck of the parade at its 25th anniversary. Secondly I want to apologize to all other DJs that wanted to play, somehow Dice and I had so much fun, that we lost track of time and ended up not letting anyone else on. Normally not my style, but somehow things got really out of hand (in a good way) and suddenly it was over before we knew it. Dice played the first 2h and I somehow ended up playing the last 3. Sadly my recording started only 15 min into the set, since I connected the recorder a little late, but you get almost the full 3h (those who listen on the radio, you can download the full set on my website). Some of you might think, wow, that is quite a hit machine there (oh yes, I know, and I am repeating myself… but I say better repeat yourself with tracks than play stupid new ones….), but hey, sunny weather, loads of fun people around, street parade…and fun… let´s not be too serious about it. Actually let´s never be too serious about anything (you hear me, Technopolice?).
<br />The vibe on the truck and around was absolutely fantastic and the views over the lake with the mountains were magical. It was one of these days when just everything was in line. We all agreed that we have to do this again next year!
<br />Thanks to all of you present and those in charge of that wonderful time!
<br />This week you hear the second and last part of the set that I played on the Hyte and Beach Love Mobile at the Street Parade 2016 in Zürich. It´s the last hour and forty minutes and I hope you get an idea of how much fun it was (I know I am repeating myself ;))</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are in the second season with Hyte at Amnesia on Ibiza. I am enjoying that this year I am playing even more dates, mostly in my beloved Main Room, but as well on the terrace. The terrace definitely has a special vibe to it and that makes at least me want to play a little differently than "normal". Then again, what is "normal"?! Anyways, I did a lot of music digging and editing in order to create, what I think, is my take on the terrace floor. What some of you might not know that in my early beginning years of DJing electronic music, I actually played a lot of house. I was part of SOAP Records and Noosa Heads and we even had a remix released on Strictly Rhythm for Planet Soul. With my Partner back then, Andre Walter, we even managed to produce a track with the mighty Marshall Jefferson ("Move Your Body") back in 1996, called "Mushrooms" https://youtu.be/_ailOTFYWko, which some today still say became an all time classic. If you have not heard it you might wanna check it out. On a side note, according to Marshall, it was a true story that I recorded, him telling us back then in our studio on the countryside outside Frankfurt. So playing vocals and house is sort of natural to me, it just has to be the right vocals and it has to have a certain vibe to it. So playing on the Amnesia terrace gave me the opportunity to bring out the (how about we call it) "nugroove funky house techno" in me. (By the way, last year I called it "new romantic house", but that is so last year ;)). Anyways, let´s get to the night itself, Bambounou opened the floor followed by Loco Dice and I played the end. If that wasn't already enough of a challenge, we used only one setup, which meant a lot of moving equipment and that is always kind of a hassle. Additionally to that we used a different mixer, which turned out to be faulty and produced the occasional distortion effects that you can sometimes hear on the recording. Good thing about this is, 25 years of DJing give you a little bit of comfort and routine in situations like this and after a kind of rocky start, I managed to really enjoy my time on that Wednesday night on the terrace. Which leaves me thinking that in the future, I might add even more nugroove funky house techno to my sets. Who knows :)
<br />What you hear on this week´s AM/FM is the second part, the final hour and a half of my set on the Amnesia terrace for Hyte on the last Wednesday in July 2016. Hope you also enjoy the rest of it and hope to see you soon, somewhere on the dance floor! Cheers, Chris</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Since 1995, the Love Family Park is not only a main part of Germany´s Techno Scene, it helped creating it and set standards for outdoor electronic music festivals and especially for the music style itself, that would influence a whole generation of sun and outdoor loving party crowds.
<br />In 2013 Cosmopop, the promoter that also runs Time Warp, decided to add a "tent" floor to the so far only outdoor stages. This way, Adam Beyer and myself were booked for the first time at LFP, a festival right next to my hometown, that I only visited before as a guest for almost 20 years. It was a great first year in the tent and I have been a regular "tent-closer" since then. But the next two years didn't go so well. In 2014, some of you still might remember, a very heavy storm hit the location late in the evening and only thanks to the professional work of Cosmopop and their amazing team, organising the evacuation, no one really got hurt. I remember ducking with a couple of other people behind a big trash container, trying not to get hit by stuff flying around. It was surreal, like a movie scene and even a day later we were still all quite in shock from what had happened so quickly. Half way during my set, I was told to announce over the mike, that everyone had to leave the tent as quickly as possible and shall head to the exits. At first I thought it was a joke, but when the first wave hit and the tent started to shake and sway, we all ran like crazy and as mentioned before, hid under a trash container for a while.
<br />In 2015 it was a terrible heat wave with up to 46 degrees and you can imagine how nicely hot it was in a tent.
<br />This year 2016 was different. The vibe and the mood in the tent were out of this world and I had so much fun as never before. To top the night of, we all ended up watching the penalty shoot out between Italy and Germany of the Euros. I was sitting next to a good Italian friend from Napoli, who almost died of a heart attack.
<br />The recordings of my set from this evening in Mainz are the two AM/FM Shows in the last two weeks of July. Today´s show contains the second part and the last hour and a half. Hope you enjoy!</p>]]></description>

This year 2016 was different. The vibe and the mood in the tent were out of this world and I had so much fun as never before. To top the night of, we all ended up watching the penalty shoot out between Italy and Germany of the Euros. I was sitting next to a good Italian friend from Napoli, who almost died of a heart attack.

The recordings of my set from this evening in Mainz are the two AM/FM Shows in the last two weeks of July. Hope you enjoy!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the fourth and last hour of a 4h Collabs live set, that Speedy J and myself played on June 3rd at the Weather Festival in Paris. I got to know Jochem Paap from Rotterdam aka Speedy J first time back in 2000 when I asked him to remix a track for me. Back then he has already been a legend for all of us, with his outstanding knowledge and ability of making amazing electronic music. Just check out his discography and it'll blow your mind. So after he agreed to do a remix for me, he also performed one of his super-energetic live sets at a monthly night I ran in a club in Frankfurt called the U60311. We started to be more in touch, and one time in Frankurt, when he played a live set before me and was just about to finish, I kind of started to mix into the end of his live act, which encouraged him to not stop and play along. As much as I remember we continued like this for about half an hour, and looking back, this was kind of our first Collabs set ever. From this moment on we started to do this more and more and also started thinking about some sort of new setup that would give us more potential to recreate music live together. At that time we kind of morphed my DJ set up with his live setup.</p>

<p>When we were about to start our first little Collabs tour, which happened to be in Australia, we spend a whole night in an apartment in Melbourne, the day before the gig, trying to find the best way to connect all of our equipment. Since both of us worked with kind of the latest hardware and software provided by Native Instruments and Ableton back in the days, all this was quite adventurous, and looking back we learned a lot by doing this. Our individual setups today are essentially the follow-ups of these early developments. Working closely with Allen & Heath as well as Native Instruments during that time really started to push the limits of what we can do. I do remember our first "official" Collabs gig in Melbourne was quite fun and interesting... and also very sweaty and rock and roll. Maybe someone who was there back then reads this now, if so please report in the comments ;) I think that was around 2003 or 2004. Around 2005 we started working on an album, which was released in 2006 on Nova Mute. It is called Metalism, for those who might wanna check it out. 10 years ago, things were a little faster. Working together with Speedy J in his studio was an amazing journey for me, not only that I got to spend loads of time in Rotterdam, I also learned so much from him… and still do. After 2008/09 we played less Collabs gigs and concentrated more on our own brands. Jochem started his very innovative and successful label and party series Electric Deluxe. We still play Collabs shows, but only about 2-3 selected ones per year. Funny is that we have the feeling that our gigs get a better flow every time we play. Last year´s Awakenings Festival was definitely in our top 3 gigs ever. Keep an eye out on Electric Deluxe, `cause that set might be published there soon too.</p>

<p>More Collabs gigs are in the planning, and who knows, maybe one day we sneak back into the studio and do a follow up to Metalism…. until then, I hope you enjoy these 4 Collabs episodes on AM/FM. And now that you actually have them all, you could put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the recording of the second and last hour of my set on the Main Stage at Movement Detroit on Monday May 30th.</p>


<p>I travelled to Detroit already on that Sunday straight from London and what a blast I had, hanging out on that festival that day without having to play. As I wasn’t aware of the full line up this year (sometimes I just don’t know…and been less online lately), I was very pleasantly surprised by all the people I ran into and got to hang out. Already checking in at the hotel met my good friend and amazing musician Guti, who invited me to the first beer and from that moment on it was all fun and games till late night/morning. Amongst having great times with Dubfire, Joseph Capriati, Moderat, Adam Beyer, Ellen Alien, Heidi, Hito, Tiga, Loco Dice, Matador and many more, I finally got to meet legendary DJ Pierre for the first time ever (some of you might have seen that moment during my set when he came on stage), who influences me till today with his wild pitch style since the early 90’s. Drinking tequila and having fun with Dave Smith and his lovely wife at his booth in the backstage also wasn’t helping to stay sober. So the Sunday already had set the mood for the Monday, which turned out to be equally exciting. I played right after John Digweed, starting before sunset and ended my set in darkness. Playing this Main Stage around this time is really something else, besides the great crowd, having these GM buildings in the background really constantly reminds you of that special place you are at. One of the birthplaces of Techno (as I believe there are many on the planet). What an honor to be there and play after all these years. Big thanks, of course next to everyone I met and saw, goes out to the Paxahau Crew who organize that whole thing. I know these guys since many years, they booked me to Detroit already over 15 years ago, when I slept in their basement (back then called the Paxahau Hotel). We have come a long way since then and they are still fully in there with their heart and passion. It is getting better year after year. Hope you enjoy the set as much as I did playing it….</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>New York, New York! One of my favourite cities in the world and how happy am I, to always be welcomed there. I can almost call it a second home by now. This week´s AM/FM show is the recording of the second hour of my set that I played at EDC NY and the second half is a B2B with my good friend Nicole Moudaber on May 15th. It was my first EDC NY appearance and the stage I played was hosted by Nicole. I arrived straight from Mexico City with little sleep, but getting on the stage right next to Citi Field Stadium and seeing such an amazing crowd having it to her set, fully energised and recharged me. I played a 90 min set first (which quickly proved to be loads of fun) and for the last hour, Nicole joined me for our first ever back to back set. We didn't really have a plan (do b2b DJs have plans actually?) and Nicole asked me how we should do this. I just said, I finish my set with a kick drum running, you mix something into that and then we see. I think it pretty much clicked immediately and the last hour was just an intense ride. Hope that comes across a little in the recording. If you are listening to AM/FM on a radio station, then you will miss the last half hour of our b2b set (due to the one hour show format), but no worries, you can download the full thing on my website, once it is out.</p>

<p>But that wasn't all really. After Nicole and I finished at 11 pm, I went over to my beloved Output Club in Brooklyn to play the after hour for another 5h. And let me use the chance here to say a big thanks again, to all the people who came out that night, to EDC and Output. It was intense, even more than ever before, it was great, it was another amazing ride with you. Looking forward to be back in July for Hyte. NYC, EDC, Nicole, Output and all of you enjoying the music, thank you once more….</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[And we are back in Italy! This week´s AM/FM is the recording of the second and last hour of a two hours set that I played at the First Festival in Genova´s 105 Stadium. So as you can see, not really a club gig, but in front of once again an amazing crowd that really knows the music. One of the reasons (besides it being another amazing night in Italy, Grazie Mille ;)) I chose this session for AM/FM is, that on this weekend I felt for the first time that I started to use my new @playdifferently mixer at a new level. Been playing with the mixer for a while now, but for this weekend I changed my setup in a way that I was able to use all channels (8 in total). I was not sure if this would be too much to handle, but it turned out easier than I thought and opened up a whole new world of possibilities. You always have to take time to get used to a new piece of equipment. I kind of see my setup as an instrument, that I have been fine-tuning over the years and adding a new mixer of course requires some new learning time. In Genova it felt like it was all coming together nicely for the first time really. It added another level of excitement for me. Not sure if you can hear it on the recording, but I had so much fun. Well again, you will be the judge. We are slowly entering the summer season now and with my new setup I feel more ready than ever before. New and exciting times with an amazing new central piece of equipment, that will hopefully make all our musical journeys together even more exciting. Now that you have both parts you could put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Hope you enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s set is the fourth and last hour of 4 hours that I played at one of the most prolific, relevant and fun clubs in Italy (which basically means in the world, as Italy is the country with the biggest history of clubs, or as I like to say with an over 2000 years long history of running events and parties). Il Muretto is in Jesolo, near Venice and every time it is quite an experience to be there, not to mention to play there. This date was not any different, or wait, somehow it was, as I felt that in all the years I played there, I seem to get to know the club better and better, and that leads to an even more intense experience every time. This was maybe the biggest night I played there yet and I am happy to realize that I continue to say that after each gig at Il Muretto. Maybe this time it was due to the fact I had a 6h tattoo session the day before or because it was Easter Sunday and my 4th gig in a row after coming back to Europe from Miami and LA?! No matter what made it so amazing again, I can only say Grazie Mille over and over again for those good times in Italy! I hope you enjoy these 4h, and now that you have all the four separate parts, you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.]]></description>

Maybe this time it was due to the fact I had a 6h tattoo session the day before or because it was Easter Sunday and my 4th gig in a row after coming back to Europe from Miami and LA?! No matter what made it so amazing again, I can only say Grazie Mille over and over again for those good times in Italy! I hope you enjoy these 4h, and now that you have all the four separate parts, you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AM/FM is the eighth and last hour that I played at the night of World League at Bob Beaman Club in Munich on the 29th of January 2016, where I was booked to play an open to close set. I had never been to the club before, so I didn't really know what to expect, especially how intimate and cosy it would be. I do love to open a night and set the tone for the rest, especially when I can also play the rest ;).  I already noticed in the very beginning that it would be quite a night, as the sound system, the layout and the crowd of the club were a perfect combination. I am used to playing longer sets in Munich, as I have done that many times before in the past 20 years that I have played in this city, but this one somehow topped all the other ones before. The night was supposed to end at 6, but I continued till past 8 and I basically only stopped because I managed to kill the amps of the monitoring system at the end, and to me that was kind of a sign that it was all said and done. I was happy, the people were happy and we all left with a smile. Now that you have all the eight separate parts, you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I hope you will enjoy the trip as much as I did. Thank you World League and Bob Beaman Club and all of the amazing people who showed up for that memorable night.]]></description>

I am used to playing longer sets in Munich, as I have done that many times before in the past 20 years that I have played in this city, but this one somehow topped all the other ones before. The night was supposed to end at 6, but I continued till past 8 and I basically only stopped because I managed to kill the amps of the monitoring system at the end, and to me that was kind of a sign that it was all said and done. I was happy, the people were happy and we all left with a smile. So all in all the set will be covered by 1h pieces in 8 weeks right here. I hope you will enjoy the trip as much as I did. Thank you World League and Bob Beaman Club and all of the amazing people who showed up for that memorable night.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the recording of the second and last hour that I played at Blue Parrot in Playa del Carmen / Mexico at the BPM Festival. It was a special night, because I had the honour to open up for Danny Tenaglia. I tried to build up my set, while having the people dancing, but not yet on maximum level, something that I have learned in the early days back in Frankfurt when I was resident at the Omen in the nineties, and which is something that I still love to do. </p>

<p>Danny followed with an amazing set later on, including some extreme goose bump moments when he paid tribute to the late David Bowie by mixing in "Let's Dance" (in his opening) and "Space Oddity" later. He just masters the craft of editing tracks and has a unique selection of music. He proved to me again the point that you should not trust a DJ younger than 45, which you can read more about here: http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9698-classics-never-die-what-it-means-for-djs-to-grow-old/ I really believe some DJs are like a good red wine…… Anyways, I hope you also enjoy the second hour of this a little bit different approach to a set. Oh, and btw., you can actually watch the whole night also on BE-AT.TV…</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM show is a recording of the second and last hour that I played on New Year´s Eve in Rome at Spazio 900 for the Cosmo Festival. What an incredible pleasure and honour it was for me to end the year 2015 and begin the year 2016 in beautiful Rome. My set started about 22:30 right after Ben Klock and I played till 1am, so right through midnight. The energy in Italy is always on maximum level, but this NYE added an even more special vibe. I wasn't really sure what to do at midnight, somehow I didn't really think about it before (shame on my lazy ass). So when midnight came closer I chose to throw in the amazing remix by Tale Of Us for Radio Slave´s "Don't stop, no sleep", knowing it has that nice break and if I timed it right, it would be happening right at 0:00. But somehow I thought it needs to be a bit more special, so I thought of a countdown, but didn't have one, then I thought of numbers… and "Numbers" by Kraftwerk came to mind, so I quickly tried to mix that in, which didn't really work in the beginning as you might notice on the recording. But I managed to fix it, so this was how that "mix" came together. Someone also gave me a mobile phone with a countdown on it, in case you wanna watch it on video, Fra909 filmed that bit: https://www.facebook.com/Fra909Tv/videos/931765546861081/ </p>

<p>Fun fact on the side: The first kick-drum of 2016 came from Italian producers (Tale Of Us) in Rome… sounds like a good Omen for 2016 in Italy. Here you have the final hour - or to be precise, the final 76 minutes of the set. Hope you enjoy!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s recording is the third and last hour of my set that I played in Grenoble for La Belle Electrique. It is no coincidence that the last AM/FM set of 2015 and the first two sets in 2016 come from a gig in France. France's scene developed so incredibly in the past 4-6 years and in the year 2015 I can recall quite a few outstanding nights, not only in Paris, Aix en Provence, Lyon or other places, but also in this case Grenoble. I have never been to Grenoble before, but for some reason the name of the city triggers images of James Bond, skiing and Olympic Winter Games in my head, don't ask me why. I love to be in or near high mountains anyways, so it was exciting for me to visit this city for the first time in my life. With Monoloc playing just before me, the night turned out to be quite deep and trippy from the beginning and the crowd seemed to be ready to just go on a ride. So here comes the third hour, I hope you enjoy… and also find some new tunes here and there…(yes, I have been digging). Now that you have all three parts you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Oh, and I even did some sightseeing the next day and went up the Bastille... quite some amazing views…]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s recording is the second hour of my set that I played in Grenoble for La Belle Electrique. It is no coincidence that the last AM/FM set of 2015 and the first couple of sets in 2016 come from a gig in France. France's scene developed so incredibly in the past 4-6 years and in the year 2015 I can recall quite a few outstanding nights, not only in Paris, Aix en Provence, Lyon or other places, but also in this case Grenoble. I have never been to Grenoble, but for some reason the name of the city triggers images of James Bond, skiing and Olympic Winter Games in my head, don't ask me why. I love to be in or near high mountains anyways, so it was exciting for me to visit this city for the first time in my life. With Monoloc playing just before me, the night turned out to be quite deep and trippy from the beginning and the crowd seemed to be ready to just go on a ride. So here comes the second hour, I hope you enjoy… and also find some new tunes here and there…(yes, I have been digging). Oh, and I even did some sightseeing the next day and went up the Bastille... quite some amazing views...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AM/FM show contains the final 1,5 hours of my set that I played for Time Warp in Brooklyn on November 21st 2015. Even though I am in New York regularly since more or less 5 years now (you can tell I love it here), it was my first appearance for the US edition of Time Warp. One of the reasons I love New York so much is that special relationship that I have with the people here (don't wanna use the word "crowd" as it sounds so anonymous). Here in New York I can really rely on some total music lovers who regularly come out to hear me play and that in many different settings. May it be the Output Club, Cielo, Pacha or one-off events in warehouses or on islands. I didn't know what to expect really, also because I came from Montreal the night before, where I played an all-nighter at Stereo, so a lack of sleep was part of the package. But my NY friends didn't let me down again. The energy push I received right from the beginning of my set, due to the overwhelming presence of nice and smiling friendly people, instantly got me into full swing and those 2,5 h set time went by like a flash. Sure I still pack in some of the older tracks that I have been pounding for a while now, but I managed to sneak some new stuff in there and everyone seemed to like it. I did plan on playing a full forward 2,5 h techno slammer, but I really like to go up and down as well, and also add more and more funk, swing and sexyness. Well, all I can say is that I had an unbelievably fun night and I thank you all for being on this journey together. Hope you enjoy the set and as always, you will be the judge if things worked out or not… Or maybe don´t judge for a while and just sit back, relax and listen ;) Now that you have both parts you could also put them together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.]]></description>

Playtimes in Greece tend to be quite late, so I started my set right after a fabulous performance by Nicole Moudaber at 5:30 in the morning. Actually this time there is not much more to say, besides I think I never had that much fun and good times ever before in Athens… and Greece has always been very good! Big up Greece! Hope you enjoy! … Oh yeah, one more inside info for you, I have had a hard time finding good new tracks in the past weeks, that's why you might recognize quite a few tracks from the weeks before, but I always try to bring them across in a new way. You will be the judge again if I manage to do so… And now you could actually put the three parts together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AM/FM episode is the third and last hour of my set that I played at Serendipity Club in Foligno. Foligno is in the centre of Italy near Assisi (the town where the famous Francesco came from). I have been coming to Italy for many years now, but I have never been to this very beautiful part. The Serendipity Club is in its 5th year now and already has an amazing reputation to be one of the leading underground clubs of Italy, so I was very happy to play there for the first time. Now some could say that my last AM/FM set from Stockholm is quite similar to this one…. and you could be right. Both are places where I had never played at before, both kind of similar size, but here it is all about the details, as mostly in Techno music. At both places I had a great time and you will be the judge if I just repeated the 3h set that I played in Stockholm or if the music comes across in a whole different way. And now you could also put the three parts together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Enjoy!]]></description>

Both are places where I had never played at before, both kind of similar size, but here it is all about the details, as mostly in Techno music. At both places I had a great time and you will be the judge if I just repeated the 3h set that I played in Stockholm or if the music comes across in a whole different way. Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s AM/FM is the third and last hour of my set that I played for Tillsammans at Slakthuset in Stockholm on October the 2nd. Coming kind of directly from our grand HYTE season closing fiesta on Ibiza, I realised that I had not been back to Sweden in 5 years. 5 Years, that is a long time and not coming to a country for that long, I wondered if people would actually still remember me or my music. But it seemed like it was more than worth the wait. I almost forgot what a beautiful City Stockholm is. The Location Slakthuset is an old Slaughterhouse, and for me, lover of a plant based diet, it was a great feeling to put this place to a much better and healthier use than what it once was intended to. I could not ask for more, the crowd was so much fun, directing and following me on an amazing 3h journey. The set was a constant give and take between me and everyone else in the room, something I wanted to pass on to you on this AM/FM show. Big thanks also to the promoters, it was so much fun with all of you, that it was really hard to leave Stockholm again. I hope to be back soon! And now that you actually have all the three parts, you could put them altogether in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the third and last hour of my set that I played on September 10th for Richie Hawtin's Enter night at Space on Ibiza. Here is a little video interview from Enter, shot just before the show: https://youtu.be/K1Sn7exH470. But please also keep reading to find out more...</p>

<p>To be honest, initially this was not my first choice of sets that I wanted to deliver to you, but for various reasons it happened to be the one. If you follow the program, you noticed that I already published a set of mine recorded on Ibiza this summer and there are many more places I get to play at besides Ibiza these days, for example in beautiful Italy. Beginning of September I played the closing of Tini Soundgarden in Cecina, which was a hell of a fun night and of course, when running a weekly podcast/radio show like AMFM, we record every set that I play. But lately we had some trouble with the recorder and sometimes ended up with no recording of the set. This was especially frustrating at Tini Soundgarden, as I really wanted to publish this one. The same happened in El Paso, the following Sunday for the Sun City Music Festival, again no recording of this night sadly. Well, when the universe tells you to let go of something, you should, so I moved on and fixed (hopefully for the future) the recorder problem. For me it became clear that the next set on my list was the gig at Enter on Ibiza, which didn´t turn out to be as easy as I expected really. After a short day off in my hometown, after returning from Texas earlier (thanks to another Lufthansa strike, that took much longer than expected), I had to fly from Frankfurt via Palma de Mallorca to Ibiza on the 10th, the day of the gig. Landing in Palma I noticed that my first connection flight with beautiful Iberia Airlines first got delayed, then cancelled. The same happened to the next one, letting me stranded at the Palma airport for good 7 hours. Anyone who knows the airport in Palma knows how much fun that is. To make a long story short, after all it took me 11 hours to travel from Frankfurt to Ibiza, arriving on the island basically just on time for my gig. I played the opening in the Main Room, starting at midnight when the doors opened till shortly past 3 o`clock, when I handed over to Richie. You can imagine it was quite hard to shake off the stress of that travel day, so I must say I did have moments during the gig where I didn't really feel what I was doing. But you gotta be professional and don't allow those things to interfere with your set. Even though I wasn't too happy about my performance, I ended up having a super fun night, hanging out with Ali Dubfire and more friends from the US who came and visited. So here is the Ibiza Enter set with all its ups and downs, and now that you actually have all the three parts, you can put them altogether in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

Here is a little video interview from Enter, shot just before the show: https://youtu.be/K1Sn7exH470. But please also keep reading to find out more...

To be honest, initially this was not my first choice of sets that I wanted to deliver to you, but for various reasons it happened to be the one. If you follow the program, you noticed that I already published a set of mine recorded on Ibiza this summer and there are many more places I get to play at besides Ibiza these days, for example in beautiful Italy. Beginning of September I played the closing of Tini Soundgarden in Cecina, which was a hell of a fun night and of course, when running a weekly podcast/radio show like AMFM, we record every set that I play. But lately we had some trouble with the recorder and sometimes ended up with no recording of the set. This was especially frustrating at Tini Soundgarden, as I really wanted to publish this one. The same happened in El Paso, the following Sunday for the Sun City Music Festival, again no recording of this night sadly. Well, when the universe tells you to let go of something, you should, so I moved on and fixed (hopefully for the future) the recorder problem. For me it became clear that the next set on my list was the gig at Enter on Ibiza, which didn´t turn out to be as easy as I expected really. After a short day off in my hometown, after returning from Texas earlier (thanks to another Lufthansa strike, that took much longer than expected), I had to fly from Frankfurt via Palma de Mallorca to Ibiza on the 10th, the day of the gig. Landing in Palma I noticed that my first connection flight with beautiful Iberia Airlines first got delayed, then cancelled. The same happened to the next one, letting me stranded at the Palma airport for good 7 hours. Anyone who knows the airport in Palma knows how much fun that is. To make a long story short, after all it took me 11 hours to travel from Frankfurt to Ibiza, arriving on the island basically just on time for my gig. I played the opening in the Main Room, starting at midnight when the doors opened till shortly past 3 o`clock, when I handed over to Richie. You can imagine it was quite hard to shake off the stress of that travel day, so I must say I did have moments during the gig where I didn't really feel what I was doing. But you gotta be professional and don't allow those things to interfere with your set. Even though I wasn't too happy about my performance, I ended up having a super fun night, hanging out with Ali Dubfire and more friends from the US who came and visited. So here is the Ibiza Enter set with all its ups and downs, but as always I leave the judgment up to you. Enjoy listening!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s AM/FM is the fifth and last hour of my 5h set that I played at Concrete in Paris on Sunday August 9th. It was a daytime party and I started to play at 3 pm. I finished just shortly after 8 pm, before Dustin Zahn took over with an amazing live set.</p>

<p>Over the past 5 years the Techno scene in Paris has developed remarkably. Concrete and the Weather Festival play an essential role in this development and the scene is very vibrant and open-minded. People are having a blast and are really open to whatever you play, as long as you play from your heart and have loads of fun while doing so. It was my third time playing on this great boat on the Seine, and I always enjoy the special atmosphere of this venue. Due to the fact that the DJ booth is right at the end of the dance floor, you are very close to everyone, which creates a certain intimacy between you and the crowd. Although I have to say that my mixing might have been off a little here and there, I chose to bring you this full 5h set, because it was just so much fun. The crowd and I really went on a journey together and I ended up playing quite a few old tracks I haven't played for a while.</p>

<p>Touring in summer and especially in August tends to be physically pretty demanding, with all the festivals and odd club days and nights. Only in the first 2 weeks of August I have been playing about 12 gigs and Paris was gig number 7 in that series. It definitely does get exhausting at some point, but that is also the point where you enter this mode in which you start to think less and just do. And as far as I believe, this is always helpful, especially when it comes to music.</p>

<p>Like I said before, it may not be the most perfectly mixed set I have ever played, but it was a lot of fun and quite a unique ride, so that I am more than happy to share this one with you. Now you actually have all the five parts so that you could put them altogeher in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. Hope you enjoy!</p>]]></description>

            <title>am/fm | 020 - Live from HYTE Ibiza, Amnesia</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week you can listen to the third and last hour of my set that I played on the Amnesia Terrace in Ibiza for Hyte on June 24th 2015 between 6 am and 7 am, right after a fantastic live performance by Henrik Schwarz. If you watch the Video (https://youtu.be/kHpqyN4IfUE), you might already get an idea why this set was quite special for me. Some might think that I am not into melodies and vocals, considering the majority of sets that are out there and that some of you have heard me playing live, but actually I am. I am a kid of the 80's and grew up listening to the music of this time and always have been a big fan of bands like The Cure, Depeche Mode, Joy Division and so on. In the past years I have rediscovered this side more and more in me and found different ways to fuse this kind of vibe with the techno that I play.</p>

<p>Hyte is now in its first season, Wednesdays at Amnesia and I am one of the residents this year among guys like Loco Dice, Maceo Plex and more. But also in the years before, I have always had a close relationship with Amnesia, since I played there for the first Cocoon season back in 1999. I do love this club and I think it is one of the best in the world. I always enjoy playing in the Club Room and I am happy that I can look back on many amazing nights not only for Cocoon, also for Music On …. and of course I am looking forward to more memorable nights in there this summer for Hyte.</p>

<p>When it became clear that Hyte and Amnesia gave me the opportunity to also play a set on the Terrace, I happily agreed, knowing this would give me the chance to go even deeper into these new musical adventures of mine, as there is not really a better environment to DJ this kind of style then on the Terrace of Amnesia. The atmosphere of this room, especially when the sun starts to rise in the early morning hours, is one of its kind. Somehow it kind of took me back into my early days of DJing, when I tried to create a journey for the dancers going through various styles of music.</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short, although I did feel a bit nervous at first, I had a blast "on the other side" and it motivated me to continue this musical journey in the future. Thanks again to everyone involved for making this happen! Have a listen and let me know what you think. Now that you have the last part, you could even put episodes 18, 19 and 20 together in a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I hope you enjoy !</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week´s show contains the end of my set at Toffler Club in Rotterdam on May 8th 2015 and was recorded between 5 and 6 am. The night was hosted by my good friend Benny Rodrigues, one of the best and nicest DJs I know. You might also know him for his ROD project, btw. a new release by ROD is on the way on CLR and if you listen closely you can hear it somewhere in the set. </p>

<p>Toffler is a rebuilt old underground tube station, which holds maximum about 400-500 people and has a quite interesting feature. The whole DJ booth at the very end of the club can move further back into the room depending on the amount of people entering the club, so the dance floor becomes bigger and bigger the more people come in. I did an all-nighter, meaning I started right at the beginning at 11 pm and played till closing at 6 am. Well actually we went till 6:30 in the end…. I really enjoy these long sets, also to start playing when no one is in yet and to be responsible for the journey through different styles over the whole night. Since the middle of the 90's when I was resident DJ at the OMEN in Frankfurt I enjoy opening a night, which sadly rarely happens these days, so the night in Rotterdam was a special one for me again. There is an interview that I did with Benny after the same night one year ago, you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnEGHf6qQwM</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy the ride with me and in case you were there that night, thanks for the great vibes and the all night dancing! We will do it again next year and I am already looking forward to it!</p>]]></description>

I did an all-nighter, meaning I started right at the beginning at 11 pm and played till closing at 6 am. Well actually we went till 6:30 in the end…. I really enjoy these long sets, also to start playing when no one is in yet and to be responsible for the journey through different styles over the whole night. Since the middle of the 90's when I was resident DJ at the OMEN in Frankfurt I enjoy opening a night, which sadly rarely happens these days, so the night in Rotterdam was a special one for me again. There is an interview that I did with Benny after the same night one year ago, you can check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnEGHf6qQwM

Hope you enjoy the ride with me and in case you were there that night, thanks for the great vibes and the all night dancing! We will do it again next year and I am already looking forward to it!</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>OK, I really didn’t plan on doing this, but I changed my mind mainly due to 2 reasons. Firstly, because of the high demand in my Facebook and twitter feed, to publish this set by those I guess mostly Argentinian fans, and secondly because it was really a very special night and quite magic two hours for me at Time Warp in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>As some of you might have noticed, I already published a Time Warp set on AM/FM some weeks ago, the one from Germany, and yes, I do play quite a lot of the same tracks, but, well different. Every night is different and so was this one. Must have been a combination of factors. Sven, who played a fantastic set before me, the amazing location with an even bigger main floor than in Germany, and me playing the closing set.</p>

<p>There were a lot of goose bumps moments or it was rather one long one. I can only say thanks again to that fantastic crowd in BA for all that support and fun we shared. </p>

<p>The new AM/FM concept is quite an experiment to be honest. It challenges me even more than before to come up with new tricks, tracks and ideas on every set, cause I never really know which one will end up getting published. I don’t wanna bore you listeners out there with the same stuff over and over again, but for the mentioned reasons I decided that you should have this one. So again, you will be judge and jury ;0)</p>

<p>What you hear on this week´s show is taken from the set I played at Time Warp in Buenos Aires between 5 am and 6 am. It is the second and last hour of my set. On the downloadable version you can even hear my encore, which I was allowed to additionally play after 6 am. … and don´t forget that you can listen two the whole set if you put the individual parts into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I hope you enjoy!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week´s show is taken from a set I played for the Used + Abused Pool Party at the Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach on March 29th. Loco Dice not only invited me to play for his party, he also asked me to play the closing slot. As some of you can imagine, playing a Pool Party in Miami after Dice is a bit stepping out of my comfort zone, but for me that is what it is all about, new challenges and I am very thankful for this one. When I started DJing more than 20 years ago, my main goal was always to give people a good time on the dance floor, but only with music that I would enjoy listening and dancing to myself. This hasn’t changed and I really want people to go home happy at the end of the night, including myself. Dice had an amazing vibe going as expected and when I took over I tried my best to keep that vibe going, while adding my flavour to it. So you will hear some of my current favourites mixed with some new stuff. Again, you’ll be the judge if I managed to reach my goal. As far as I remember, those who were present had a good time till the end ;). What you hear on this week´s show is the music I played between 8 and 9 pm, the second half of my set and final hour of the party. The first hour of my set can be found on last week´s episode of AM/FM. Enjoy.]]></description>

            <itunes:summary>This week´s show is taken from a set I played for the Used + Abused Pool Party at the Surfcomber Hotel in Miami Beach on March 29th. Loco Dice not only invited me to play for his party, he also asked me to play the closing slot. As some of you can imagine, playing a Pool Party in Miami after Dice is a bit stepping out of my comfort zone, but for me that is what it is all about, new challenges and I am very thankful for this one. When I started DJing more than 20 years ago, my main goal was always to give people a good time on the dance floor, but only with music that I would enjoy listening and dancing to myself. This hasn’t changed and I really want people to go home happy at the end of the night, including myself. Dice had an amazing vibe going as expected and when I took over I tried my best to keep that vibe going, while adding my flavour to it. So you will hear some of my current favourites mixed with some new stuff. Again, you’ll be the judge if I managed to reach my goal. As far as I remember, those who were present had a good time till the end ;). What you hear on this week´s show is the music I played between 8 and 9 pm, the second half of my set and final hour of the party. The first hour of my set can be found on last week´s episode of AM/FM. Enjoy.</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[This week's show is taken from a set I played at the Time Warp festival in Mannheim, Germany on the 5th of April 2015. Time Warp turned 21 this year and every participating artist will agree when I say that it is the "annual Techno and House family gathering" we all look so forward to. It is a rare thing, that you get to hang out and see others play in such an amazing atmosphere, everyone wanders from stage to stage over the course of the night or simply hangs out in the backstage. Good times are guaranteed and that is what brings that extra bit of excitement to every Time Warp. This year I was playing at floor one from 7 - 9 in the morning after Pan Pot, who played after Carl Cox, who played after some more of the finest artists that Techno has to offer these days. So I knew that there was quite a party already on for several hours, making me wonder what I should do to keep the vibe alive and kicking. What you hear on this week´s show is the music I played between 8 and 9 am. The first hour of the set can be found on last week´s show, so that you could put both parts together in a playlist and listen to the entire set with seamless transitions. Enjoy.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week's show is taken from a set I played at Stereo in Montreal, Canada on the 27th of Feb 2015, well actually already the 28th, since Stereo is a so called "after hours" club according to Canadian law (correct me if I am wrong). This means that the club opens around 2am, can't serve alcohol, but stays open as long as it wants. My set time started at 7 in the morning and I ended up playing for 5 and a half hours. What you hear on this week´s show is the music I played between 11:30 am and the end of my set at 12:30. The first 90 min of my set can be found on the very last episode n° 315 of the CLR Podcast and the following three hours on the first three of AM/FM shows. Together with today´s show you have the entire five and a half hours long set I played. You could even put all of the parts into a playlist and listen to the whole thing with seamless transitions. Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to am/fm by Chris Liebing. This show is all about the music in the moment it was played. It kind of functions like an audible dj diary. The idea behind it is that I choose a recent set that I played and deliver it to you unedited, raw and direct, in 60 minutes pieces on a weekly basis. For example, if I play a three hours set somewhere, it will be divided in three 60 minutes long am/fm shows, so after three weeks you will have the full set. You could even put them into a playlist and listen to the whole set with seamless transitions. I try to keep the commentaries to a minimum, so that you get a maximum amount of music. Still, I want to mention certain things during the show, but beyond that, I will provide additional info in form of a written set report, which can be found on www.chrisliebing.com or on my facebook-site.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is Monday the 9th of March 2015 and today we are publishing the very last CLR Podcast. After exactly six years that have passed since the first one, many great artists have contributed excellent sets to this series. Today is the day to send out a massive thanks to all of them - and equally important, to say thanks to all the loyal listeners. It has been a great time for Chris Liebing and the whole team and we can´t stress enough how much we appreciate the incredible amount of support we have received, but it´s time to move on and to do something new. You will be able to find a weekly show at the same spot; it will have a different concept and a correspondingly different title. Chris will present you something very direct and a little more personal, something you could call an audible dj diary of his life on the road. So please stay tuned and listen up for more details on the new show in today´s voiceovers and obviously in the first edition next week.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is Monday the 2nd of March 2015 and we have Terence Fixmer back on the CLR Podcast, celebrating the release of his brand-new album DEPTH CHARGED, which is exclusively out on beatport since last week, and which will be released on all digital portals, CD and vinyl next week. In a career that spans two entire decades, Terence Fixmer has produced numerous genre-defining classics, has toured the planet continuously and has reached worldwide recognition and praise. It has often been quoted that his music maintains musical depth and integrity, even in a club- or festival-context, and that it appeals as much to dancing feet, as it does to the searching soul. DEPTH CHARGED, his fifth solo album, proves this claim with certainty and excellence. If you would like to know more about Terence Fixmer, his music and his tour schedule, please visit:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is Monday the 16th of February 2015 and we have Albert van Abbe back on the podcast, this time with a LIVE performance, which he recorded last July in Berlin. The set consists exclusively of original productions, mostly unreleased material, all arrangements and dubs were done on the fly and he did most of the sound-design himself as well. Albert is one of the very few Dutch Techno live acts, having performed Berghain, Awakenings & ADE just to name a few. For 2015 he is working on a brand-new audio-visual live performance entitled NDEBELE, which he will present at the STRP Biennial in his hometown Eindhoven as the after-show for Underworld's “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” concert on March 27th.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>CLR Podcast 310 – Simo Lorenz
<br /> 
<br />It is Monday the 2nd of February 2015 and we are coming to the end of our little series of local heroes and faithful supporters of the Techno scene, this time with Simo Lorenz from Stuttgart´s distinguished Lehmann club. Simo loves to play extended, passionate DJ-sets, not only in his residency at the Lehmann, but also in numerous renowned national and international clubs. His digital DJ setup allows for a maximum of real time creativity and in the studio he is a prolific producer of original tracks and remixes, some of which appeared on labels such as Wall Music, Nachtstrom Schallplatten, Drowne Records or Illegal Alien, just to name a few. He furthermore co-founded the booking agency Blakksheep at the end of 2014, with artists like Alex Bau, Sam Paganini, Sasha Carassi, Luis Flores, Johannes Heil, himself and many more in the roster. Simo is celebrating his 30th birthday on the 15th of February at the so-called “Dirty Thirty” event at the Lehmann.

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 310 – Simo Lorenz
 
It is Monday the 2nd of February 2015 and we are coming to the end of our little series of local heroes and faithful supporters of the Techno scene, this time with Simo Lorenz from Stuttgart´s distinguished Lehmann club. Simo loves to play extended, passionate DJ-sets, not only in his residency at the Lehmann, but also in numerous renowned national and international clubs. His digital DJ setup allows for a maximum of real time creativity and in the studio he is a prolific producer of original tracks and remixes, some of which appeared on labels such as Wall Music, Nachtstrom Schallplatten, Drowne Records or Illegal Alien, just to name a few. He furthermore co-founded the booking agency Blakksheep at the end of 2014, with artists like Alex Bau, Sam Paganini, Sasha Carassi, Luis Flores, Johannes Heil, himself and many more in the roster. Simo is celebrating his 30th birthday on the 15th of February at the so-called “Dirty Thirty” event at the Lehmann.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 309 – the CZAP

It is Monday the 26th of January 2015 and today we have a local hero from Koblenz, Germany on the CLR Podcast. Born 1979 in Poland, the CZAP moved to Germany in 1989 and quickly became a faithful follower of quality Techno. He has been clubbing in several of the most happening German clubs including the legendary Dorian Gray in Frankfurt and is inspired by the likes of Adam Beyer, Chris Liebing, Speedy J, DJ Rush, Steve Rachmad and Carl Cox. After playing in numerous local clubs and some festivals like for example Nature One, the CZAP acquired a residency at U60311 and currently holds a residency at the “Unter Tage” club in Koblenz, where he has been an important element of the team since the very beginning. After a fantastic first year, the “Unter Tage” team has just established a new open-air location, called “Über Tage”, which will celebrate its season opening on Saturday the 6th of June.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 307 – Peter Eilmes

It is Monday the 12th of January 2015 and today we continue our little series of local heroes. This time we have the pleasure to present you a set by Peter Eilmes, one of the most active dj/producer/promoter in Frankfurt - a city with a long and eventful electronic music history, which is also the birthplace of CLR. In a relatively short period of time, Peter (a.k.a. Plattenpeter) managed to become a resident dj at several of the most significant clubs in the area. As a party-promoter he has done a lot of grass-roots-work for the local Techno scene and has also been very busy and prolific in the studio. His productions have been released on various respected labels and he has played at globally well-known clubs and festivals such as Tresor, Space Ibiza and Nature One. With his profound love for music and his highly professional work ethos, Peter is continuously building his reputation as a reliable, technically skilled artist with an excellent intuition for the needs of the crowd.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 305 – Alex.Do

It is Monday the 29th of December 2014 and today we have another new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Alex.Do was born in 1989, the year when the Berlin Wall fell, which can also be seen metaphorically as it symbolizes the meeting of two forces, two trends which are reflected in the life of the young artist.  From Techno, Dub and House of all decades and seasons he creates something that can be called the essence of electronic music. In his DJ-sets, which are deep, last several hours and give you the feeling of being on another planet, he can live his melancholic, introverted side. At the same time, his pulsating mood sweeps are electrifying and characterize his personality as well as his productions. With the DYSTOPIAN team he has not only found comrades-in-spirit, he has also found a platform for his music style and the possibility of performing shows in Berlin and all over Europe. If you are in Berlin on Tuesday the 30th of December, you can actually hear him play at the Arena Club as part of the four days HYTE festival. For further information about his upcoming gigs and releases, please visit:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 304 – Woo York

It is Monday the 22nd of December 2014 and we have new guests for the very first time on the CLR Podcast. The Kiev-based duo Woo York has come a long way from being Ukraine capital’s local heroes to becoming an internationally recognized live act with their own signature sound. They are not only residents of legendary Glaswegian label Soma Records and head honchos of Planet Rhythm, they have also been delivering one dance floor killer after another since the start of their career back in 2009. Known for their energetic live acts, Woo York combine experimental, dance floor oriented and avant-garde elements into a highly improvisational musical flow with a strong hardware background. The entire music in this set is performed and improvised live during one of their recent gigs and contains two tracks from their upcoming debut 5 tracker EP on Life & Death called The Valley of Songs.

It is Monday the 15th of December 2014 and we have a new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast.

Since then he has dedicated his entire time to his passion and has plunged deep into the capital's thriving electronic music scene. Under Len Faki’s friendly wings and DJ Deep’s expert and encouraging critic, the young producer keeps on working and delivering new material, which has already convinced numerous of the godfathers of electronic music. Roman Poncet´s productions are easily oscillating between genres and releases on the labels Arts, Deeply Rooted and Figure have gained him massive respect and support in the global scene.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 301 – Ø [Phase]

It is Monday the 1st of December 2014 and today we have Ø [Phase] back on the CLR Podcast. The UK based DJ & techno producer is best known by his work on the Belgium based Token Records. Beginning his recording career on London's Lost/Cosmic records and later forming a fruitful bond with Token, Ø [Phase] has released some of the most well executed and critically acclaimed techno in recent history - 'Morodem', 'Fragmenta' and the immaculate 2012 two tracker 'Binary Opposition’ among the examples. His reputation among other producers has progressively earned him more and more worldwide recognition and seen him remix for the likes of Robert Hood, Marcel Dettmann and Mark Broom. In 2013 he released his debut album ‘Frames of Reference, a highly functional techno album of real imagination and depth. The present recording is an exclusive studio mix featuring some of the artists he is interested in and some of the tracks he has been playing in his club sets recently.

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 301 – Ø [Phase]

It is Monday the 1st of December 2014 and today we have Ø [Phase] back on the CLR Podcast. The UK based DJ &amp; techno producer is best known by his work on the Belgium based Token Records. Beginning his recording career on London's Lost/Cosmic records and later forming a fruitful bond with Token, Ø [Phase] has released some of the most well executed and critically acclaimed techno in recent history - 'Morodem', 'Fragmenta' and the immaculate 2012 two tracker 'Binary Opposition’ among the examples. His reputation among other producers has progressively earned him more and more worldwide recognition and seen him remix for the likes of Robert Hood, Marcel Dettmann and Mark Broom. In 2013 he released his debut album ‘Frames of Reference, a highly functional techno album of real imagination and depth. The present recording is an exclusive studio mix featuring some of the artists he is interested in and some of the tracks he has been playing in his club sets recently. He is currently working on fresh solo material and on as yet announced remixes, so if you would like to know more about his upcoming releases and tour dates, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 295 – Monoloc


It is Monday the 20th of October 2014 and we have Monoloc back on the CLR Podcast. Today is the beatport release of the “Things EP” (CLR083), which features three new mixes of the popular album track by the Berlin based CLR artist. Rødhåd and Roman Lindau, two of Monoloc´s favorite producers and DJs have contributed excellent versions of the original and Monoloc himself has crafted a truly outstanding edit for this purpose. It can be heard at the very end of the present, exclusive podcast set. CLR083 is one of those releases that characterises the increasingly open-minded direction CLR has taken over the last years and is equally interesting to DJs from all kinds of stylistic branches of the scene. It will soon be available on vinyl and on all digital platforms and will surely grace countless record bags and playlists all over the world. If you would like to know more about Monoloc and his upcoming release- and tour-schedule, please visit his website:

            <description><![CDATA[It is Monday the 13th of October 2014 and we have Chris Liebing back on the CLR Podcast with a one hour long excerpt of the set he recently played at Richie Hawtin´s “Enter” night at Space Ibiza. He was the first to play in the Main Room, the doors had just opened and people came in, quickly filling the floor. Chris really enjoyed playing this unusual set and felt like sharing it with you. This is why the whole two and a half hour recording is available in highest mp3 quality and with very few voiceovers as a special download on www.clr.net. He also used it as the soundtrack of a video showing a pretty special bicycle ride through Frankfurt, which he did as part of the preparation for the fund-raising project “#cycle2ADE”, and which you will be able to find very soon on his new youtube channel. Right now, he and numerous leading artists and industry figures are cycling from London to Amsterdam to raise money for building a music school in South Africa and you are very much invited to go to his facebook site, where you can find the link to donate some money for this good cause.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 293 – Rebekah

It is Monday the 6th of October and we have Rebekah back on the CLR Podcast. Today her first sampler EP in CLR´s new “Mind Sets” series is released in all the shops, while the second sampler is released exclusively on beatport. The two EP´s feature exclusive tracks from Perc, Pfirter, Brian Sanhaji, Operator, Dark Chambers, Dualit, Bas Mooy and herself. The one and a half hours long mix compilation, which is the remaining part of this new format will be out in November. Rebekah has been conquering the hearts of countless music lovers and party people worldwide with her dynamic blend of electronic music. She is an internationally requested artist who spends most of her remaining time working on her own music and has quickly gained respect amongst her peers for her uncompromising trademark style as a producer. The present mix is a studio recording, which is slightly different to her forthcoming “Mind Sets” compilation mix. It is a selection of more dark industrial techno.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 290 – Chris Liebing
 
It is Monday the 15th of September 2014 and we have CLR label founder and CLR Podcast host Chris Liebing himself back on the show. The present set is part of a recording from a gig he played in the beginning of September in a small club called Tipic on Formentera. It features loads of upcoming CLR releases, remixes as well as original productions and shows a slightly different, rather laid back and hypnotic side of Liebing´s musical spectrum. You can feel the sun and the captivating vibe of the Balearic summer in this recording. The regular podcast is taken from the second half of the set, while the entire three hours long mix with very few voiceovers can be found as a special download in the highest mp3 quality on the podcast site of www.clr.net. We hope you enjoy this extraordinary dj-mix by Chris Liebing and invite you to find out more about the man´s tour schedule and the label´s upcoming releases on the following sites:

It is Monday the 18th of August 2014 and we have legendary dj/producer Mike Dearborn back on the CLR Podcast.

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 286 – Mike Dearborn

It is Monday the 18th of August 2014 and we have legendary dj/producer Mike Dearborn back on the CLR Podcast. Though he was born on Chicago's south side and grew up listening to house, Mike´s recordings for Djax-Up-Beats have been embraced more by the worldwide underground Techno and Tech-House axis. His output as a producer includes club classics like "Strictly Underground," "Hardcore Swinger" and "Unpredictable", as well as the critically acclaimed “Ready For War” long-player on Majesty Recordings, which made his name around the world as one of the toughest producers around. He has remixed internationally renowned acts such as Hardfloor, Joey Beltram and Steve Stoll and has been playing the world´s best clubs and festivals for many years now. For more information about his upcoming releases and his European tour in September and October, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 285 – ROD

It is Monday the 11th of August 2014 and we have a returning guest on the CLR Podcast. ROD is the alter-ego of Rotterdam based Benny Rodrigues, currently one of the most popular and inspiring electronic music artists of the Netherlands. Known for his versatility, Benny has chosen this additional artist name to clearly define the more Techno oriented side of his musical identity. The present recording was a warm-up for Chris Liebing´s 5 hours set at Toffler in Rotterdam on June 6th, where ROD put the focus on building an atmosphere with abstract ambient soundscapes, broken electronics & deeper Techno, before Chris and Speedy J, who also teamed up for a two hours long Collabs set in the course of the night, took the people to the next level. With his vast knowledge of music, his undying love for Techno and his sharp taste, ROD is firmly placing himself in the top tier of the new school generation of Techno artists. He has some exciting releases lined up on MDR, Drumcode, CLR and Semantica, so if you would like to inform yourself about his dj- and release-schedule, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 282 – Albert van Abbe

It is Monday the 21st of July 2014 and we have a new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Albert van Abbe, hailing from Eindhoven has been active in the underground arts scene since 2001. The DJ, live PA and “No Comment” label owner since 2010 is definitely one of the underdogs of the electronic music scene. Hidden away from the big European techno hubs, and being quite happy with that, he feels that he can create original output. Van Abbe's main focus alongside the label is performing live. He has been crafting and presenting his live performances worldwide under different monikers since 2002. Uncompromising, visceral and melancholic are words that come to mind while experiencing his performances and listening to his records. Next to the live performances, his lustful collection of vinyl is rapidly growing as well, and the best way to learn about Albert's love for deeper dance music is to hear him dj, so we hope you enjoy this exclusive vinyl-only DJ mix including some of his unreleased tracks. For further information on Albert and his projects, please visit:

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 282 – Albert van Abbe

It is Monday the 21st of July 2014 and we have a new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Albert van Abbe, hailing from Eindhoven has been active in the underground arts scene since 2001. The DJ, live PA and “No Comment” label owner since 2010 is definitely one of the underdogs of the electronic music scene. Hidden away from the big European techno hubs, and being quite happy with that, he feels that he can create original output. Van Abbe's main focus alongside the label is performing live. He has been crafting and presenting his live performances worldwide under different monikers since 2002. Uncompromising, visceral and melancholic are words that come to mind while experiencing his performances and listening to his records. Next to the live performances, his lustful collection of vinyl is rapidly growing as well, and the best way to learn about Albert's love for deeper dance music is to hear him dj, so we hope you enjoy this exclusive vinyl-only DJ mix including some of his unreleased tracks. For further information on Albert and his projects, please visit:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 281 – Sian

It is Monday the 14th of July 2014 and today we have Sian back on the CLR Podcast. In what was undeniably his busiest year to date, the ever-diligent Octopus Recordings label headman has rocked big dance floors from Buenos Aires to Bangkok and from Tokyo to Toronto. Carefully cementing his reputation at the edge of the European new wave, with unique and fresh sounding top ten chart bombarding singles and armed with a fast growing worldwide radio show, his Octopus brand is now counted among the top 5 selling Techno labels on the planet, seeing the likes of Victor Calderone, Nicole Moudaber, Ambivalent and Slam appear on the white hot imprint alongside himself. His new album ¨2 meters above midnight¨ just came out on Octopus and he is touring USA in August (Electric Zoo, Sun City Music festival etc). Apart from that he has a track named  “Chicken Donut” on the new Drumcode compilation album and recently started some new secret projects, so 2014 promises to become another landmark year for this fearless exponent of classic modern Techno.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 280 – Daniel Wilde

It is Monday the 7th of July 2014 and today we have Daniel Wilde back on the CLR Podcast. As a dj Daniel is taking audiences on a journey by mixing up an eclectic mixture of styles, even including Indie tracks, blending them with straight bass-lines, Berlin House and dubby Techno. Apart from his dj-ing he has also been gathering recognition as a singer, songwriter and producer. You might know his voice from the latest Tiefschwarz album Chocolate or his live performances with this much-respected duo. For CLR he wrote three songs on Monoloc’s debut “Drift”, which he also sang and co-produced, adding a deep and soulful dimension to this unconventional techno long-player. He has been collaborating with big names like Audiofly, Re.You, Marcus Meinhardt, Adam Port or Santé and released records on Souvenir Music, Mobilee, Supernature, Liebe*Detail, Heinz Music, Stil vor Talent, 8bit and CLR. Beside his work as producer and singer for different projects, Daniel´s dj career made a massive leap, taking him not only to Barcelona, where you could find him playing at off-Sonar and Werk It, but also to Lisbon, Copenhagen, WMC Miami, Sullivan Room New York or Watergate, Kater Holzig, Wilde Renate & Club der Visionäre.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 279 – Raíz

It is Monday the 30th of June 2014 and today we have Vangelis and Vidal Vargas pka Raíz back on the CLR Podcast, two well-known producers and label owners from Los Angeles who have performed worldwide from North America to Europe to Japan. Through their connection with Drumcell they developed the label, production group and music collective Droid Behavior, which has become one of the most important institutions for Techno in the United States. Aside from curating forward thinking events such as Interface, Raíz have released affective music on labels including Electric Deluxe, Historia Y Violencia, Droid Recordings and their own label VRV. As performers, Raíz fully harness the capabilities of technology to create a thick blend of Detroit-influenced Techno and hard, gritty House. Years of production experience inform their Live PA / Digital DJ hybrid approach, as they layer each track’s core essentials and live improvisation to craft sets into a unique and narrative arch. Their releases follow suit, drawing from their musical training and diverse influences, to shape elegant and deep tracks. The present set was recorded on the third day of the Detroit Movement Festival at the Underground Stage. Raíz have just released two EPs in June and have a European tour lined up in October. If you would like to know more about Raíz and their upcoming projects, please visit:

The Ibiza based DJ/producer has played at almost all of the island´s popular venues including residencies for Spinclub at Space and Privilege, as well as be@Space in 2009. In the summer months you can regularly hear him spinning tunes at the exotic Bambuddha Grove, where he holds a residency since eight years and the exquisite El Chiringuito at Es Cavallet beach, where he started his residency three years ago. He is equally comfortable and capable playing downtempo sets or different styles of House music through to deep melodic Techno. In 2010 he launched Rogue Recordings to showcase his productions and music from talented local producers. The label has picked up support from some of the planet's finest and most respected DJs including Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Marco Carola, Joris Voorn, Laurent Garnier and many more.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 274 – Mike Parker

It is Monday the 26th of May 2014 and we welcome back Mike Parker from Buffalo, New York on the CLR Podcast. Mike has been producing music since the 90's and lots of people know him from his extensive output on the Geophone label. In recent years, his tracks have also been showcased on labels like Prologue, Mote-Evolver, Semantica and many others. Mike's sound has a distinctly analogue character and his production ethos implies the precise rehearsal of the tracks, which are recorded live, without any subsequent edits and overdubs. His latest release on Mote-Evolver, "Spitting Electricity" just hit the shops a few weeks ago, following up last year's album "Lustrations" on Prologue.  Later this summer Prologue will release a special EP of remixed tracks from this album by Svreca, Cassegrain and Edit Select. The present recording is an all vinyl set recorded live in Mexico City on the 18th of April 2014 for the "Twice As Proper" 7th Anniversary party. Mike is currently touring Europe and you can find the tour dates on the following sites:

It is Monday the 19th of May 2014 and we welcome back the L.A. based Techno activist, prolific producer and worldwide requested DJ Truncate on the CLR Podcast. David Flores started djing at the age of 15 and started to produce his own music under the moniker Audio Injection only a few years later. Since being associated with local event production group Droid Behavior in 2003, you can find him as a resident at the infamous Interface warehouse events as well as a regular producer for Droid Recordings. In early 2011 he started the project Truncate, which focuses on the deeper and more raw side of Techno. His Truncate releases have been gaining support from big players such as, Ben Klock, Marcel Dettmann, Chris Liebing, Speedy J, DVS1, Luke Slater, Ben Sims and many more. With his heavy remix, production and touring schedule there is no slowing down in the near future for David as he continues to shape his own sound, putting Droid Behavior and Los Angeles on the Techno map.

In his live performances, Jeff uses Ableton and Maschine to create a hybrid set that weaves loops, tracks and samples together, concocting a potent, hypnotic blend. He is a core member of Speedy J´s influential Electric Deluxe label crew and has been releasing on some of the most significant international Techno imprints. Jeff has brought some of the biggest Techno players to Chicago and teaches music technology by day.

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 272 – Jeff Derringer

It is Monday the 12th of May 2014 and we welcome Jeff Derringer for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The renowned Chicaco based producer and performer is a resident at Smartbar and the curator of Oktave, an event series that focuses on the world’s best underground Techno talent. Blending a propulsive beat with noise, abstract melody and a healthy dose of kick drum, Jeff’s unique brand of techno comes from decades spent as a drummer, multi- instrumentalist and technologist. In his live performances, Jeff uses Ableton and Maschine to create a hybrid set that weaves loops, tracks and samples together, concocting a potent, hypnotic blend. He is a core member of Speedy J´s influential Electric Deluxe label crew and has been releasing on some of the most significant international Techno imprints. Jeff has brought some of the biggest Techno players to Chicago and teaches music technology by day.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 270 | Clemens Neufeld</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 270 – Clemens Neufeld

It is Monday the 28th of April 2014 and we welcome the Austrian Techno pioneer Clemens Neufeld for the very first time on the CLR Podcast. Clemens was the founder and resident DJ of Vienna´s first Techno Club "Space Jungle" since 1991. Originally he used to be a band musician, and started producing Techno and House records in 1989. Since the early 90s he released hundreds of records under his own name and various pseudonyms on international top House and Techno labels like Strictly Rhythm (as "Giant Wheel"), Richie Hawtin's Definitive Records (as "Future Legends"), Confused, Spielzeug, Missile, Planet Od Drums and many more. He started his first own label FÖN in 1996, carried on with GIANT WHEEL RECORDS since 2000, and now he is releasing on his 3rd label NEUFELD RECORDS. As the years go by, Clemens stays faithful to his unique trademark style of very high energetic, but also subtle and subliminal sound. The current set is a pure vinyl mix full of rather old Acid Techno tracks without any loops, tricks and effects. If you would like to know more about Clemens Neufeld, his labels and his recently released debut album “Clemens”, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 259 – Mike Dearborn

It is Monday the 10th of February 2014 and we have Mike Dearborn for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Over the past few years the legendary Chicago born and raised Producer/DJ had been pursuing interests outside of music and has recently come back to the world of Electronic Music with a series of outstanding releases and gigs at some of the most popular clubs and festivals world-wide. In late spring he will re-launch his label Majesty Recordings as a digital platform and has several collaborations and new releases of his own lined up. The undisputed pioneer and much-respected Underground Techno veteran has been inspiring the global scene since 1985. He is not only a master of his Classic Techno Sound, but stays on top of new music and plays current Techno as well. For 2014 Mike plans to continue taking his sounds on the road with multiple shows in Europe and the US.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 254 – Tony Rohr

It is Monday the 6th of January 2014 and for the first CLR Podcast of the year we welcome back a returning guest. The Brooklyn born Tony Rohr has delivered us an excerpt of a live recording from one of his recent gigs at Treehouse in Miami, which contains an upcoming release entitled "Careless Suggestions", one of the tracks he produced together with Layton Giordani (playing from 48:00 until 52:00 minutes). For the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014 he has slowed down his dj schedule to be able to entirely focus on his love for studio work. Having released on top labels such as Cocoon, Weave, Plus 8, Drumcode, Podium and Frankie Records, Tony Rohr is one of the most sought-after artists in the industry. His truly original, indefinable sound is gathering ideas through early Hip-Hop, House, Industrial and finally Techno, and his unique Live PA is consistently in high demand.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 249 – Steve Parker

It is Monday the 2nd of December 2013 and we have a new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Steve Parker from Porto is one of the leading figures in Portugal´s Tech House and Techno scene and an internationally respected DJ/producer. He has released various EPs on labels like SCI+TEC (“Switch Box EP”), Quartz Rec (“Get Systematic EP”), Synewave, Sleaze, Harthouse and many others including his own imprint SPARK. One of his upcoming releases is the “Sugar High EP” in 2014 on Ovum Recordings, to celebrate the label's 20th anniversary. Things actually began moving for Steve in a big way when Josh Wink, an artist he always admired, released his "Escuro EP" on Ovum Recordings in 2012, that´s why the upcoming three tracks release on this highly influential label is a massive thrill for him.

It is Monday the 11th of November 2013 and we have Psyk back on the CLR Podcast with a brand-new live set he just recorded this weekend at a warehouse party in London. Today CLR is actually releasing "Eclipse" (CLR072) on beatport, one of Psyk´s tracks Chris Liebing has been playing out heavily for months and which he considers his Techno anthem of the summer. In two weeks time it will come out in all the other online stores and also on a very special vinyl, featuring the original version and an edit by Chris Liebing. Over the last years Psyk has been busy honing his skills and refining his art as a DJ and producer. The exceptional artist from Madrid has been releasing music on some of the finest labels in the scene and is currently working on his debut album, to be released in May 2014 on Luke Slater´s label Mote Evolver. His own label NON SERIES will celebrate its second anniversary in exactly two months, on January 11th 2014 with a label night at Berghain in Berlin. The upcoming NON 010 release in early December will be an LP  of Chevel entitled "Air Is Freedom". By today Psyk has become a highly significant, internationally successful DJ/producer and is receiving massive support from many of the biggest players in the scene.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 245 | Daniel Miller</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 245 – Daniel Miller

It is Monday the 4th of November 2013 and we have Daniel Miller for the first time on the CLR Podcast. It is actually the very first podcast the founder of the legendary independent label Mute Records has ever released, which makes the occasion even more special than it is already for us. Chris Liebing and the CLR team are completely psyched about the fact that this iconic musician, DJ, producer and label-head not only played on our recent ADE party, but also went to the Mute studios afterwards to record the present mix. It is loosely based on the mentioned performance at the Studio 80 in Amsterdam and if you would like to know how much Chris Liebing enjoyed meeting one of his true heroes, you only have to listen to the voiceovers of the present podcast. There is just too much to say about this man who has discovered, signed and produced several highly influential bands since the late 70s, including the undisputed and still relevant Depeche Mode. Daniel Miller completely embraced the Punk ethics of “Do It Yourself” but eventually saw the synthesizer as the ultimate conclusion of the whole Punk idea. Instead of a guitar and the ability to play a couple of chords, you just needed a cheap synthesizer, no skills at all and only your imagination to create something unique and amazing. His enthusiasm for electronic sounds is still unbroken and we are very excited to present you this exclusive DJ mix.

It is Monday the 14th of October 2013 and we have Monoloc back on the CLR Podcast. Born and raised in the Techno metropolis Frankfurt am Main / Germany, the longtime studio neighbour of Chris Liebing and Brian Sanhaji owes a lot of inspirational moments to the special vibration and the deep-rooted electronic music scene of this genre-defining city. Over the last years, Monoloc has not stopped touring and releasing highly significant productions on various prestigious labels, including his recent debut album “Drift” and the corresponding remixes on CLR. In his productions he draws influences from all kinds of musical styles and incorporates them skillfully in his mind-bending, deep and elegant Techno sound. The latest release is the “Try EP” (CLR 070), which apart from the original album version includes an excellent Skudge remix and a brand-new, very club-friendly edit by himself. Today the busy DJ/producer delivers us another one of his irresistibly bass-heavy Techno sets. If you would like to know more about Monoloc, his upcoming release- and tour-schedule, or his label Smallroom Music, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 241 – Ø [Phase]

It is Monday the 07th of October 2013 and we have Ø [Phase] for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The UK based Techno producer is best known for his work on the Belgium based Token Records, whose style ranges from gritty Minimal Techno to Detroit influenced material. Originally a Mastering engineer, Ashley began producing as a sideline, releasing his debut EP 'Module Overload' on Steve Bicknell's Lost/Cosmic records in 2000. This was followed by a string of productions for London's Surface/Inceptive Records and Ben Sims Ingoma imprint, all of which saw consistent big name support throughout the Techno community. After releasing his much acclaimed 'Binary Opposition' single on Token Records in 2012 and the subsequent 'Reprocessed' remix package, recent times have seen him remix for the likes of Robert Hood, Peter Van Hoesen & Mark Broom amongst others while avid support from Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock have led to several appearances at Berghain in Berlin. His DJing continues to take him across the globe, having performed in Rome, Oslo, Amsterdam, London, Stockholm, Brussels, Shanghai and beyond.. His debut album 'Frames Of Reference' will be released on Oct 21st 2013 on Token Records (BE) with a package of very special remixes to follow.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 240 | Tommy Four Seven</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 240 – Tommy Four Seven

It is Monday the 30th of September 2013 and we have Tommy Four Seven back on the CLR Podcast. His excellent production skills and characteristic trademark style can not only be found in numerous memorable original productions, but also in his much acclaimed remixes and collaborations. His latest venture is a co-operation with Alain, of the respected One Million Mangos mastering studio in Berlin and is called THESE HIDDEN HANDS. Through Hidden Hundred - the creative platform and outlet they’ve constructed for themselves – they are set to release their highly anticipated, self-titled debut album, a project that epitomises the intuitive approach Tommy has taken towards his work thus far. He is not only an inspiring producer and sound designer, but also an internationally demanded DJ. Since relocating from London in 2008, he has gone on to position himself as a core CLR member, using his own studio in an industrial sector of the city as a base from which to craft the acutely visceral Techno sound he calls his own. If you would like to know more about Tommy Four Seven or THESE HIDDEN HANDS, please check out the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 238 – Nicole Moudaber

It is Monday the 16th of September 2013 and we are very happy to have Nicole Moudaber for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Born in Nigeria and raised in Lebanon, Nicole discovered the fascination of House music on one of her travels to New York, when she went to the Tunnel Club and got infected by the House and Techno bug once and forever. Back home in post-war Lebanon she introduced this sound to her fellow people, organizing hugely successful events with Christians, Muslims and Jews dancing to the same beat, until the government decided that those manifestations of flamboyance and freedom went against the conservative grain of the system and she became a victim of police harassment. Determined to be free, she relocated to London where she promoted a monthly night at Turnmills and started running a record label. Finally it was none other than Carl Cox who noticed her outstanding talent, mentioned her in a Rolling Stone interview as “the most underrated DJ” and booked her for his summer residency at Space / Ibiza. Since then she has been playing her much loved blend of House and Techno all over the planet, has released her Number 1 hitting debut album “Believe” and has been featured in several of the most popular music magazines. Nicole Moudaber is an electronic music artist and an activist at the forefront of a rebellion from the underground. Beyond commercial goals, she is continuously on the search for this special vibe of love, freedom and unity she first experienced in New York´s Tunnel Club and which made her choose her current dedication to deejay and produce music. If you would like to know more about Nicole Moudaber and her upcoming gigs and releases, please visit the below mentioned sites, and if you are in Germany on the 31st of October, you can experience her at the Halloween edition of the CLR residency at Butan Club in Wuppertal!

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 237 – Drumcell

It is Monday the 9th of September 2013 and we have Drumcell back on the CLR Podcast. The man who just released his debut album on CLR has provided us with a very special set he recorded at this year´s Movement Festival in Detroit. He was playing on the underground stage together with a massive line up of all North American artists when heavy rain caused everyone to flood and overpack the stage. The extreme circumstances caused a very special vibe and Drumcell remembers this night as his favourite in all of his 13 years long history of attending the festival. In October Moe Espinosa pka Drumcell is off to tour in Europe, supporting his excellent first long-player “Sleep Complex”, a truly unique version of modern Techno beyond genre-limitations. In the unconventional, suspenseful approach you can still hear the Industrial and Noise roots of the dedicated Techno ambassador from Los Angeles´ San Gabriel Valley. CLR and Chris Liebing, who took care of the final mixes, can highly recommend you “Sleep Complex”, which is available digitally, as CD and as limited triple vinyl record. Tomorrow, on Tuesday morning, 30 hand numbered and signed vinyl copies of the album with exclusive custom silk screened artwork by Drumcell himself will be available at http://climbmountanalog.com/ . For more information on “Sleep Complex”, further upcoming releases and tour dates, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 236 – Sian

It is Monday the 2nd of September 2013 and we have Sian back on the CLR Podcast. Born in Dublin, raised in Southern Spain, he chose early to drop out of normal society and engage in the extraordinary. Adhering more to the avant-garde side of club culture, his tracks show an otherworldly, slow and hypnotic slant on big speaker electronic music. Apart from releasing his very personal, inventive and often unusual blend of modern Techno on some of the most respected labels in the scene, he also runs his own imprint called Octopus Recordings. After constantly hitting Beatport top ten positions and gathering glowing reviews, the label has now become one of the top 5 selling Techno labels worldwide. Sian is regularly appearing at the planet´s most respected clubs and festivals in Europe, Asia, USA, Canada, Eastern Europe, South America, Australia and beyond. The present set was recorded live at Sian´s debut at Club Air in Japan, a packed out night of Techno in the heart of Shibuya, Tokyo. Using 4 decks, 4 effect units and additional tools, Sian was playing a bunch of unreleased and current Octopus tunes.

It is Monday the 19th of August 2013 and we have Material Object back on the CLR Podcast with a very special set including several of his latest, previously unreleased collaborations. In his dj sets and productions, Material Object fuses the sound of voltage controlled synthesis with the funk of modern Techno to forge something which is both classic and fresh.

Last year he worked on three different collaborations with undisputed luminaries from the Techno world including the 'MAGNUS' project with Tim Xavier, the co-operation with Dustin Zahn as 'MODZ', which was released on the Los Angeles based 'Droid Recordings' label, as well as the second album length collaboration with the late German ambient mastermind Pete Namlook on his renowned Fax + 49-69/450464 label. 2013 is also looking promising for Material Object, with the second MAGNUS release, a collaboration with Mexico's Techno Artist and Droid Recordings regular Luis Flores as 'IMPACT UNIT', as well as loads of tour dates including performances at Berghain in Berlin, together with Tim Xavier as MAGNUS, live ambient sets alongside AtomTM for Berlin's CTM festival and a  special ambient Pete Namlook tribute set at this year's Labyrinth Festival in Japan.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 233 | Giorgio Gigli</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 233 – Giorgio Gigli

It is Monday the 12th of August 2013 and today we have Giorgio Gigli back on the CLR Podcast. Since his first appearance in our podcast series the Italian DJ/producer has not only been busy playing out at numerous renowned international venues, but has also been working hard in the studio. The results can be heard in form of some excellent releases like the “INSIDE EP” which is out on Speedy J´s label Electric Deluxe, his collaboration with George Paar “Life Is Not Dead Yet”, out on Paar Wax or his upcoming joint venture with Obtane entitled “Perception Through Dissonance” (Rrose Remix), which will be released soon on Prosthetic Pressings. His multi-layered, intricate style is the result of an acute exploration of several kinds of electronic music and his personal evolutionary path as an artist has led to the liaison with one of the most respected Techno labels in the scene. Starting from 2011 the collaboration with Electric Deluxe has established an intense relationship ferrying his DJ set in a new dimension where it combines an industrial/dark approach with a solid stream of club-oriented Techno. If you would like to know more about Giorgio Gigli or his own imprint “Zooloft Records”, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 232 – ROD

It is Monday the 5th of August 2013 and we have the pleasure to welcome back Benny Rodrigues, a long-time friend, restless DJ and excellent producer from Rotterdam. The present two hours set has been recorded under his alter ego ROD, an additional artist name he chose to clearly define the more Techno oriented side of his musical identity. ROD’s critically acclaimed debut-release ‘Malmok’ was released on Ben Klock’s Klockworks label and formed the start of a fruitful discog that reads very positively received releases on various renowned labels. Next to his praised original productions, ROD is also a well in demand remixer and has crafted ‘trademark ROD’ reworks for seminal Techno-classic such as ‘Slam- Positive Education’ (Soma) and Carl Craig's '69- Poi Et Pas' (Planet E) among others. But above all ROD is known for his deeply rooted DJ-sets, which bring him to many Techno-hotspots around the world. During his highly regarded RODnacht events in Rotterdam, he usually and effortlessly plays long 8 hours marathon-sets, showcasing all the many shapes & forms Techno has to offer. He has releases coming up soon on Klockworks, Semantica and CLR. For further information on ROD, please visit the following sites.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 229 – Dario Zenker

It is Monday the 15th of July 2013 and we have Dario Zenker for the first time on the CLR Podcast. After growing up in Germany’s Deep South on a diet of Wu Tang, Gangstarr, Michael Jackson and sweet mustard, Dario eventually got infected by the Techno bug and ended up playing his debut set at the legendary Ultraschall in Munich alongside Acid Maria and the Hacker. 2006 saw his vinyl debut and since then he has produced and released numerous remixes and original productions with his own unique brand of House and Techno on labels such as Vakant, Frozen Border and Time to Express, just to name a few. Today, apart from gourmet cooking and Kung Fu wrestling his compadres, Dario channels his energy into two projects in particular. Founded by him, his brother and partner in crime Marco and longtime sidekick Mueller, Ilian Tape is their homegrown label, nurtured with much tender love since 2007. The present mix includes tracks by himself, his brother and by their common project Zenker Brothers. We hope you enjoy this exclusive studio set and invite you to visit the following sites for upcoming releases, tour dates and further information on Dario Zenker and Ilian Tape:

            <title>CLR Podcast | 228 | Audio Injection</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 228 – Audio Injection

It is Monday the 8th of July 2013 and we have Audio Injection back on the CLR Podcast. David Flores, the man behind this moniker is actually one of the most prolific characters in the North American Techno scene. Apart from Audio Injection he also creates cutting edge electronic music under the name Truncate, focussing on the deeper, more raw side of Techno. Being associated with the L.A. based event production group Droid Behavior since 2003, you can find him as a resident at the infamous Interface warehouse events as well as a regular producer for Droid Recordings. Over the years his music has gained worldwide attention and has made it onto the playlists of many big players, which eventually led him to gigs at some of the worlds biggest clubs including Berghain in Berlin and Fabric in London. He is also now regularly touring all over the world in Australia, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Central & South America, all throughout Europe and the U.S.A. Chris Liebing is one of the most faithful supporters of his music and has mentioned on various occasions that the amount of Audio Injection and Truncate tracks in his sets often sums up to almost a quarter of his entire gig. We are very happy to present you a brand-new two hour studio mix by this highly influential Californian Techno ambassador, which gives you a good idea of the much hailed Audio Injection and Truncate sound.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 225 – Henning Baer

It is Monday the 17th of June 2013 and we have Henning Baer for the first time on the CLR Podcast, a passionate Techno DJ and producer who has been slowly building an excellent reputation in his hometown Berlin and beyond. As one half of the team behind the Grounded Theory Berlin project he has hosted numerous events with some of the most credible players in the current scene, including Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Surgeon, Chris Liebing, Function, Redshape, Traversable Wormhole, Perc, Terence Fixmer to name a few. Apart from hosting some of Berlin´s best underground events, Grounded Theory is also a booking agency and a soon to be label. Looking after DJ Pete, Sleeparchive, Milton Bradley, Subjected, Moerbeck & Sawlin (Vault Series), Fanon Flowers, John Osborn and Sawf, it is easy to see that Henning is building an ever-expanding stable of strong talent, that will shape the face of Techno for years to come. As a DJ he can be found playing his trade not only at his Grounded Theory events, but also at legendary Berlin clubs such as Berghain, Tresor or Stattbad, as well as an increasing number of appearances around the globe. His own musical productions and remixes have been released on labels such as Adam X’s Sonic Groove, M_Rec Ltd., Krill Music, Rauh and Psyk's Non Series and his own imprint K209, which he runs with his partner in crime Milton Bradley.

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 224 – Dense &amp; Pika

It is Monday the 10th of June 2013 and we have Dense &amp; Pika for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Emerging mid-2011 with a series of hand-stamped white-label releases, they have since become a must-check facet of true, modern underground Techno. Covetted by the likes of Surgeon, Blawan, DJ Koze, Levon Vincent, Chris Liebing, Jackmaster, Sven Vath, Adam Beyer &amp; Scuba with the latter signing the duo up for a series of 12"s for his Hot Flush imprint, Dense &amp; Pika's output has received such support that 2013 has seen them touring extensively with their live show around the world. Their next EP is out in June on Hotflush. The present set has been recorded live at Free Your Mind Festival in Holland to the 4000 strong crowd you can see on the podcast graphics, as the sun finally broke through the clouds. To find out more about this inspiring duo, their upcoming tour dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 223 – Kyle Geiger

It is Monday the 3rd of June 2013 and we have a returning guest back on the CLR Podcast. Kyle Geiger from Indiana  is no stranger to the international Techno arena. With releases on heavy hitter labels such as Drumcode, Soma, Perc Trax and Droid he has continuously been pushing the boundaries of his sound. On his own label Cubera he has been realizing new musical concepts free of any outside limitations, with the end objective being to create a more moody and memorable collection of productions. Originally inspired by the harder, percussive stylings the Techno sound featured on seminal labels from the late 90's, Kyle has witnessed the evolution of the genre as it morphed into a more accessible, groove based sound. Still loving the energy and power of the more straight forward side of Techno while embracing the genre's changes, Kyle has refined his productions and DJ sets into what very well may be a new breed of soundscapes that pushes things forward for the next generation of Techno to come. Next to a series of upcoming releases with production partner Hans Bouffmyhre and the Insulate EP on Cubera, he has a couple of projects coming out on Cocoon Recordings, including one on their yearly box set compilation. He is furthermore completing his first artist album for Soma Recordings within the next month. Many of his brand-new and unreleased productions are featured in the present podcast set. If you would like to know more about this prolific producer and exceptional DJ, his upcoming tour dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 222 – Rebekah

It is Monday the 27th of May 2013 and we have Rebekah back on the CLR Podcast. Since  she joined the CLR artist roster last year, the Berlin based Producer/DJ has become a much appreciated part of the crew and has been playing numerous successful club gigs, festivals and label events world-wide. Apart from the release of this podcast, today also marks the day of her first CLR release  of original tracks entitled “Cycles EP”. Over the last years her characteristic blend of straight forward, banging Techno has made a lasting impression on some of the biggest players in the scene. Her productions have been played at countless venues all over the planet and the present EP is another perfect example for her highly creative and effective approach in the studio. If you are a friend of modern quality Techno you should definitely pay attention to this excellent four track EP, which is available as digital downloads and on vinyl. Anyone who has seen her play out live knows first hand that there are no gimmicks or clichés about Rebekah, just unadulterated raw talent and a passion for the music she plays.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 221 – Sam Paganini

It is Monday the 20th of May 2013 and we have a new guest for the first time on the CLR Podcast. Sam Paganini is not only an internationally acclaimed DJ but can also look back on two decades of music production and several very successful releases. The first record which clearly defined his style, entitled Paganini Traxx “Zoe” became number 1 in the English club charts and was highly rated and appreciated by the specialized press. It was supported by Sasha, John Digweed, Paul Oakenfold and later remixed by Timo Maas. From 2000 onwards Sam's discography contains releases on Southern Fried, Octopus, Terminal M, Phobiq, Material, 1605 Music Therapy, Driving Forces Rec, Android Muziq, Amazing Records, 303 Lovers, Toolroom, just to name a few. Many of his recent productions have been played by some of the most popular Techno jocks such as Richie Hawtin, Dubfire, Marco Carola and countless others. 2011 marked another milestone in his career, when Richie Hawtin signed Sam´s "Cobra EP" for his legendary label Plus 8 Records. Following releases on Drumcode have made it into the top ten again, and right now he is actually occupying rank number 1 in the beatport Techno charts with his  "Body To Body EP", which is out on Cocoon Recordings. One of the tracks from this EP entitled "Polyester" is actually included in this exclusive podcast mix.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 220 – Black Asteroid

It is Monday the 13th of May 2013 and we have a returning guest on this week´s CLR Podcast. Bryan Black is back with a two and a half hour live mix from a recent and memorable performance in Berlin. The man who is not only known for his membership of the mythic MOTOR, but also for his excellent productions and dj sets as a solo artist by the name of Black Asteroid, has delivered this exclusive mix to celebrate today´s release of his remix of Depeche Mode´s new single “Soothe My Soul” on Sony / Columbia Records. He actually knows the band very well from opening on tour for them with MOTOR and just recently Martin L. Gore wore a Black Asteroid t-shirt when he appeared on the popular Letterman tv show. Those who have been to a Chris Liebing gig lately might as well have heard one the additional Black Asteroid Techno dubs of “Soothe My Soul” already, as the CLR label head is not only a faithful Depeche Mode fan since the 80s, but also a big supporter of Black Asteroid´s music and those incredible remixes - which will be released in the near future. The new Black Asteroid EP “Black Acid Remixed” was also just released on Speedy J´s label Electric Deluxe, featuring quality remixes by Len Faki, Alva Noto, Perc, and DJ Emerson & Angel Costa. Forthcoming Black Asteroid remixes for The Bloody Beetroots, Huoratron, Erphun, Brian Burger and Jeaven are already waiting in the pipeline as well as an EP of original material due out this Summer. Apart from his busy production schedule, Black Asteroid has been continuously on the road for twelve weeks now, including many CLR events and there is much more to come. For further information about upcoming tour and release dates, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 219 – _Unsubscribe_It is Monday the 6th of May 2013 and we have none other than English Techno legend Dave Clarke and his partner, the hotly-tipped young Dutch producer Mr. Jones as the duo _Unsubscribe_ on today´s podcast for you. Just a couple of year´s ago they met at a frantic sold out gig in Utrecht and tentatively set about doing some remixes together for artists like Black Asteroid, Octave One, Boys Noize, Erol Alkan, Gessaffelstein, Marc Romboy & Ken Ishii amongst others. Their first original production together entitled ‘Spek Hondje’ will be released on May 13th and features the American vocalist ‘Bear Who?’. It forms the crux of the _Unsubscribe_ duo’s debut single for Houndstooth - a release made to take Techno back to its most honest roots. Today´s set has been recorded by Mr. Jones in the characteristic _Unsubscribe_ manner. Their unusual project name was chosen by Dave Clarke, as a way of being subtle about him constantly being sent music that would never feature in his sets and signifies a clean start. When Chris Liebing asked Dave Clarke for a remix of the first Black Asteroid EP on CLR in 2011, the duo had just met, accepted the request and delivered a fantastic version of this memorable track.]]></description>

            <title>CLR Podcast | 218 | Roman Lindau</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 218 – Roman Lindau

It is Monday the 29th of April 2013 and we welcome Roman Lindau for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The self-proclaimed music-junkie is not only a passionate, experienced and internationally successful DJ and producer, he also runs ‘Fachwerk’, one of Berlin´s most prominent labels of recent times together with his pals Mike Dehnert and Sascha Rydell. The imprint is known for it´s consistent delivery of heavy Techno sounds that are doused in Dub and finished with a characteristic analogue authenticity. As a DJ Roman is combining a varied selection of raw House and Techno, which often takes him to some of the most acclaimed venues of the capital such as Berghain, E-Werk and WMF, as well as to a number of clubs across Europe. When producing on his own, the results are economical but efficient tracks like ‘Raumgestaltung’, which appeared on Len Faki’s Berghain 03; ‘Keppra’, which appeared on Ben Klock’s Berghain 04 mix (and on the Berghain 04 vinyl release) and he is currently working on his debut solo album. If you would like to know more about Roman Lindau, his upcoming original productions, remixes, tour dates and events that form part of the ongoing ‘Fachwerk’ label tour, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 217 – Speedy J

It is Monday the 22nd of April 2013 and we welcome back an undisputed Techno legend on the CLR Podcast. Speedy J, the acclaimed dj, producer and label-owner from Rotterdam is back with an exclusive set and is announcing a very special event on upcoming Monday the 29th of April. It is not only Queensday again — Holland’s biggest and most popular national holiday — it is also the 5th anniversary of Speedy J´s “Electric Deluxe Presents” parties. EDP was launched in spectacular style five years ago with a memorable event with Richie Hawtin at Melkweg, Amsterdam, and since then there have been many EDP highlights with a rich spread of names gracing line-ups along the way. For this very special anniversary happening, Speedy J will play alongside Chris Liebing, Maya Jane Coles, Todd Terje, Henrik Schwarz, Seth Troxler and many more at the impressive riverside industrial location Maassilo in Rotterdam. Queensday alone would already be a good reason for a travel to Rotterdam, but taking into consideration that there is also EDP´s highly promising birthday bash, you should really make sure to be in town and attend this one. For further information on the event as well as Speedy J´s upcoming tour dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <itunes:summary>CLR Podcast 217 – Speedy J

It is Monday the 22nd of April 2013 and we welcome back an undisputed Techno legend on the CLR Podcast. Speedy J, the acclaimed dj, producer and label-owner from Rotterdam is back with an exclusive set and is announcing a very special event on upcoming Monday the 29th of April. It is not only Queensday again — Holland’s biggest and most popular national holiday — it is also the 5th anniversary of Speedy J´s “Electric Deluxe Presents” parties. EDP was launched in spectacular style five years ago with a memorable event with Richie Hawtin at Melkweg, Amsterdam, and since then there have been many EDP highlights with a rich spread of names gracing line-ups along the way. For this very special anniversary happening, Speedy J will play alongside Chris Liebing, Maya Jane Coles, Todd Terje, Henrik Schwarz, Seth Troxler and many more at the impressive riverside industrial location Maassilo in Rotterdam. Queensday alone would already be a good reason for a travel to Rotterdam, but taking into consideration that there is also EDP´s highly promising birthday bash, you should really make sure to be in town and attend this one. For further information on the event as well as Speedy J´s upcoming tour dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 216 – Norman Nodge

It is Monday the 15th of April 2013 and we welcome back a returning guest on the CLR Podcast. Since 2005 Norman Nodge holds a monthly residency at the Berghain in Berlin and has been releasing music on the club´s famous in-house label Ostgut Ton as well as Marcel Dettmann´s MDR. Just a few months ago he mixed the compilation “Berghain 06”, which was released on Ostgut Ton and which combines legendary Techno classics with previously unreleased, exclusive tracks in a versatile and thrilling mix. In his dynamic sets Norman deftly avoids current trends and effortlessly moves through a wide spectrum of unusual sounds and all kinds of musical genres. His style could be described as a sometimes just timeless and serious, sometimes courageously experimental and abstract Techno-Funk. The whole idea of his truly outstanding sets is to make people dance while they explore new sounds and forgotten tracks beyond any hypes. Due to his widely respected productions and dj sets he has become a key figure in the capital´s Techno scene and we are very happy to present you this exclusive mix.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 215 – The Advent

It is Monday the 8th of April 2013 and we welcome back another returning guest and legendary Techno artist on the CLR Podcast. Cisco Ferreira a.k.a. The Advent started his career after leaving school in 1986, studied audio engineering and worked as an engineer for artists and projects as diverse as Derrick May, Fingers Inc, P.I.L., Robert Plant and Maxi Priest. After several critically acclaimed solo efforts he formed the duo The Advent together with ex-partner Colin Mc Bean in 1994. After their separation he continued with the brand and just released another The Advent long-player entitled Sonic Intervention last September. The album gained much praise and support from numerous influential Techno peers and got special respect for its musical versatility. It contains co-productions with Cari Lekebusch, Jason Fernandes and The Industrialyzer, as well as the vocals of Detroit Grand Puba’s Paris Du Black Fu on one of the tracks. It is a very personal album which reflects all the musical genres that inspired him over the years - Electro, Electronica, Tech House and Techno. Cisco is currently on the extended and highly successful Sonic Intervention tour, which will continue until the end of summer 2013. If you would like to know more about The Advent, upcoming tour dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 214 – Ben Sims

It is Monday the 1st of April 2013 and we welcome back a returning guest and legendary Techno artist on the CLR Podcast. Ben Sims is a dj, producer, label head and event organizer who has spent basically all of his conscious life exploring different facets of underground dance music. Throughout that time, the man has honed his reputation as a tight, energetic mixer who skilfully weaves together his own distinctive blend of tough funk and hardgrooves, often using three-deck wizardry and plenty of dexterity. Be it at clubs like Fabric London, Atomic Jam, Berghain, Florida 135, or any number of festivals around the world, Sims’ sets are powerful, memorable, and unique, while constantly pushing the boundaries of a DJ set – utilising a mesmerizing blend of vinyl, CDs, and software. He is a prolific producer who has put his name to more than 50 releases in the last two decades. During those years, there has also been a steady stream of high profile remixes of scene heavyweights, including Jeff Mills, Adam Beyer, Kevin Saunderson and Chris Liebing, which have been released on some of the most popular and credible labels in the scene. After releasing his debut long player Smoke & Mirrors in 2011 on Drumcode, Ben is currently on another studio lockdown working on a new album, that´s also why the present mix features lots of brand new and unreleased material, plus some exclusive edits and plenty of rarities and oddities.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 212 | Carl Craig</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 212 – Carl Craig

It is Monday the 18th of March 2013 and we welcome one of the undisputed founding fathers of Detroit Techno for the first time on the CLR Podcast. This week´s set is by none other than the legendary Carl Craig, who has been continuously delivering genre-defining and visionary productions since his first release in 1989. He has been described as a creative visionary, a groundbreaking electronic music icon, an inspirational artist, an esteemed Grammy-nominated composer, a world-class DJ and an ambassador for his native Detroit. Yet the common thread that runs through Craig’s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. He has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward thinking. Craig helped launch the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF) in 2000 and has also created the non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation, which supports young artists and helps to develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of his birthplace and current base Detroit. On Friday the 22nd of March he will play at CLR´s WMC nighttime event at Space Miami and the whole crew is very much looking forward to this memorable get-together of some of the finest artists in today´s Techno scene. If you would like to know more about Carl Craig, his upcoming gigs, releases and his influential label Planet-E, please visit the following sites:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 211 – Marc Romboy

It is Monday the 11th of March 2013 and we welcome back Marc Romboy on the CLR Podcast. Little has to be said about this passionate ambassador of the universal language of Techno and House who started his successful career in the year 1992. The prolific producer who founded the highly influential labels “Le Petit Prince" in 1994 and “Systematic Recordings” in 2004 has been releasing music on many of the most credible labels in the scene and has been restlessly spreading his very personal blend of soulful Techno House all over the planet. His latest recording endeavour is the excellent album he produced together with the Japanese Techno master Ken Ishii entitled “Taiyo” (Japanese for ‘sun’, the origin of everything). Even with 7000 kilometres between them, they managed to produce an album that is as much about the duo’s shared musical vision, as the inevitable flicker of creative conflict that marks collaborations of this nature. Indeed, to Romboy and Ishii, the challenge of balancing these subtle differences lies at the core of the album, where the most interesting and unexpected sonic ideas are spawned. Over seven tracks the pair managed to craft an album of intricate next-level Techno, simultaneously creative in its sound design and with enough drive to excite a dance-floor, proving that distance is no barrier when two such superbly talented musical alchemists undertake a collaboration. For further information about “Taiyo” and a variety of excellent remixes, as well as current information about Marc Romboy, his upcoming releases and gigs, please visit:

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 208 – Terence Fixmer

It is Monday the 18th of February 2013 and we welcome back a returning guest on the CLR Podcast. Terence Fixmer is one of France’s most illustrated characters of the Techno scene, of which he has been at the forefront for over 10 successful years, bringing his dark, atmospheric sound to prestigious dance floors that range from Berlin's mecca of techno to Paris‘ Rex club. His instantly recognizable interpretation of modern Techno  deftly avoids repetition by developing soundscapes that appeal to the club crowd, whilst still maintaining musical depth and integrity. It has been accurately stated that the music of this exceptional electronic musician who forms part of the CLR artist roster appeals as much to dancing feet, as it does to the searching soul. With the release of his brand-new  Psychik EP, which came out last week on CLR, Terence Fixmer added three excellent tracks to his extensive discography. Apart from two of the tracks featured on the EP, Terence also included two upcoming releases on his own Planete Rouge label by the artists Hubot and Alexey Volkov in this podcast set. He is about to start recording a new solo album, so if you would like to know more about Terence Fixmer, his upcoming dates and releases, please visit the following sites:

            <title>CLR Podcast | 205 | Luis Flores</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 205 – Luis Flores

It is Monday the 28th of January 2013 and we welcome back a returning guest on this week´s CLR Podcast. Luis Flores is one of Mexico´s most popular Techno producers and live acts, who is widely known for his diversified and groovy style. A minimal use of elements results in a rich spectrum of textures and a dark and trippy dance floor pull. Live shows, improvisational in nature, can last anywhere from one to three hours, resulting in a hypnotic exploration of the possibilities of electronic production. He has been a Techno activist at the forefront of the Mexican scene for the past 15 years and has worked as the artistic director of the highly influential label Nopal Beat Records, providing a stage for local producers. Luis Flores has had several original tracks in the playlists of many of the biggest players in the scene and has played his much-loved live sets at countless renowned clubs and festivals worldwide. We are very happy to present you one hour of his Live PA recorded at the Time & Space Festival in Tulum on December 21st as this week´s CLR Podcast. If you would like to listen to the full 90 minutes recording of this gig, you can download it as a special download on www.clr.net.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 204 – Michael Klein

It is Monday the 21st of January 2013 and we welcome Michael Klein for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The Frankfurt born and Berlin based DJ/Producer is known for giving each one of his performances the unique touch of a live set by using various decks, controllers and drum machines - always pushing the existing technical boundaries. After being turned on to Techno in Frankfurt´s nightlife of the 90s, he started studying audio engineering during the day and spun records at night. When he had finished his studies he moved to Berlin to set up his studio and received first recognition as one half of the formerly known DJ duo Klein & Meister. Hard work and total dedication to his passion had finally paid off when DJ Emerson signed them on his acclaimed label Micro.fon where he recently had his debut release as a solo artist. His productions are recognised and supported by artists like  Laurent Garnier, Chris Liebing. Speedy J, Danny Tenaglia, Drumcell, Dubfire, Carlo Lio and many more. We are exited to present you Michael Klein´s exclusive studio mix on today´s CLR Podcast and invite you to find out more about this inspiring artist on the following sites:

            <title>CLR Podcast | 203 | Rødhåd</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 203 –  Rødhåd

It is Monday the 14th of January 2013 and we are very happy to welcome Berlin born and raised Rødhåd for the very first time on the CLR Podcast. He is currently considered one the capital´s most promising talents as well as one of the best European vinyl DJs. His sound could be described as some kind of hypnotic, deep Techno with atmospheric and dubby textures. The constant flow he creates in his extended sets by exclusively using vinyls and CDs is truly outstanding. He also is a founding member of the Dystopian group, a Berlin based platform which is successfully hosting Techno events since 2009 and which started the Dystopian label in 2012 with two excellent Rødhåd EPs entitled “1984” and “Blindness”. Rødhåd regularly plays at Berlin´s infamous Berghain club, often unannounced, usually starting on Sundays to play his elegant and mesmerizing, sometimes eight to ten hours long closing sets on the main floor. Over the last few years he has become a word-of-mouth favourite in Berlin´s Techno scene and we are very happy to present you this exclusive set.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 200 – Chris Liebing & CLR 

It is Monday the 24th of December 2012 and we are not only celebrating Christmas day, but also the 200th episode of the CLR Podcast. For this memorable occasion, Chris Liebing has asked all CLR artists to provide an exclusive set to be included in a zip-file, which you can get for free as a “Special Download” on ww.clr.net. While today´s regular podcast features the first hour of Chris Liebing´s recent Time Warp / Holland gig, the mentioned zip-file contains the complete two hours long set with hardly any voiceovers, as well as brand-new mixes by Black Asteroid, Brian Sanhaji (live), DJ Emerson, Monoloc, Rebekah, Terence Fixmer and Tommy Four Seven. We invite you to go to the “Special Download” section on the podcast page of our website and get this generous package of more than 10 hours of quality Techno. Several of the artists have also left voice messages for you, which have been included in the podcasts. With this special 200th-podcast-anniversary-Christmas-gift, Chris Liebing and the whole CLR team would like to thank you for the incredible support over the last 200 weeks. We still really enjoy doing those weekly podcasts, so there is no end in sight. For more information on Chris Liebing and the other CLR artists, please check out the following sites:

            <title>CLR Podcast | 155 | Silent Servant</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 155 - Silent Servant It is Monday the 13th of February and we welcome Silent Servant for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The Central American born dj and producer has performed worldwide in clubs from Berlin, Los Angeles to Osaka. He is closely connected to the Sandwell District label and is currently working on a full length LP for Hospital Productions. His Remix of Planetary Assault System´s “Bell Blocker” is going to be released this month on Ostgut Ton. Silent Servant describes his sound as a reinterpretation of early '80s post-punk electronics, paired with the deep, metallic sounds of Basic Channel and Downwards. The present 2 hour mix was recently recorded live and in one take in the Harbor City / Los Angeles. For all kinds of information on Sandwell District and Post Sandwell District, please visit the below mentioned blog.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 154 – Cosmin TRG It is the 6th of February 2012 and we welcome Cosmin TRG for the first time on the CLR Podcast. The Romanian born, Berlin based producer is known for his constant sonic evolution and is currently praised for his unique, ghostly, sketchy techno blueprint, which fuses shuffling drums with eerie synths, snatched vocals-as-instruments and strains of Detroit and Chicago classicism. He has released original productions and remixes on some of the most respected labels in the world of electronic music and his debut album came out last year on Modeselektor´s “50 Weapons” imprint. As a dj he is playing at some of the best clubs worldwide, always trying to give the crowd an immersive, unpredictable soundtrack for their night out. There is a distinguished and distinguishable sonic personality about all of this restless innovator´s output and we hope you enjoy his exclusive set.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 149 – Alex Bau It is Monday, January 2nd 2012 and we welcome back Alex Bau on this first CLR Podcast of the new year. From the very beginning of the Techno movement Alex has been a dedicated and loyal ambassador of this sound. He is dj, producer and label head of his own imprint “Credo” and can look back on an impressive list of original tracks and remixes.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 120 | Edit Select</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Please listen up, the man from Scotland is back on the CLR Podcast. Tony Scott, pka Edit Select, who some might remember as Percy X (his alter ego on Soma Records) has been producing electronic music since the early nineties. He has remixed Adam Beyer, Slam, Gary Beck, Mark Broom, Death in Vegas, and has lately been doing some remixes for CLR – to the label´s great joy. 

As for many techno artists who have been around for a while, acid house was the catalyst to kick start his DJ career in 1989, with Todd Terry's "Black Riot" and Richie Rich's "Salsa House" being pivotal records for him. In 2007, he started the Edit Select record label, which has since yielded an output that is consistently high in both quality and popularity amongst the cream of the techno crop.

Enjoy this CLR Podcast 120 with one of Scotland´s busiest producers, Tony Scott as Edit Select in the mix.]]></description>

            <title>CLR Podcast | 119 | DJ Emerson</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Long-time CLR Podcast artist Emerson is back with another one of his thrilling sets.  As a now respected veteran of Germany’s techno scene, Emerson struck a chord with multilayered techno; enriched in quality and indicative of his synthetic electronic style. Founder of the esteemed Micro.fon imprint, he has opened the door and brought driving techno from its barren lands to a new territory built upon groove and bounce.
With releases on CLR Sublabel Spinclub, Sub Static and his own Kiddaz.fm Emerson has moved through the last decade unearthing a fledging reputation as a turn‐to producer for those who love a gutful of groove despite how driving and hard‐faced the music may be. Upcoming gigs: 11.06 musica electronica @ douala ravensburg / germany 12.06 elektrochemie @ alter wartesaal köln / germany 18.06 kiddaz & friends @ tresor berlin / germany

            <title>CLR Podcast | 118 | Raíz</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Los Angeles born and bred, Vangelis and Vidal Vargas were raised in
the ’80s on a steady diet of Latin freestyle, electro, and new wave
that pervaded their urban environment. Their father also exposed them
to cutting edge progressive acts Vangelis, Tangerine Dream and
Kraftwerk, planting early seeds for aural exploration. By the mid ’90s
they were sampling LA’s underground club scene and heavily researching
electronic music’s roots. After years of influence they began to
express their musical vision through their own recordings and
performances. Vidal and Vangelis eventually found common ground with
producer / performer Drumcell, and in 2002 they formed the Droid
Behavior event production group and record label out of frustration
with the city’s lack of knowledge, acceptance, and understanding for
Midwest-bred techno and house music and their European counterparts.
As producers Vangelis and Vidal have released and licensed original
music and remixes under various aliases (most notably Acid Circus and
Raíz) on the Droid Recordings imprint as well as respected labels
Historia y Violencia, Tora Tora Tora, DJMag, Music Man, Resident
Advisor, Enemy Rec, Gynoid, Reloading, Micro.Fon and Timefog. Their
music has been charted, played and supported by Speedy J, Chris
Liebing, Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, DVS1, Levon Vincent, Jonas Kopp,
etc.
Their intense and inspiring performances have placed them alongside
major players Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, Derrick May, Dan Bell,
Surgeon, Sandwell District, Robag, Paco Osuna, Pan Pot, Marco Carola,
Detroit Grand Pubahs, and Ostgut residents at undergrounds, festivals,
after hours, and club nights all over the Americas, and Europe
including Berghain in Berlin.
The members or Raiz not only produce for Droid recordings but also
help manage the label as well over see all event production, bookings,
the droid podcast, and blog site.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 117 | Perc</title>
            <description><![CDATA[From his earliest demos to his current position as a key figure in the global techno scene, Perc (aka Ali Wells) has taken the established forms of the music he loves and twisted them into something new and fresh.
Building up successful relationships with scene-leading labels such as Drumcode, Ovum, Kompakt and CLR whilst unleashing a strong run of releases on his own Perc Trax label has seen Perc’s influence and support grow even further. With each release his sonic experimentation has taken another leap forward without losing sight of the dance floor.
2009’s ‘Throb’ on Ovum and ‘Submit’ on CLR brought Perc his first support from the key Berlin tastemakers and his 2010 releases including ‘BCG’ (Perc Trax) and ‘Monad V’ (Stroboscopic Artefacts) have made him an essential artist for those with an interest in techno that refuses to conform to preconceptions. 2010 has ended on a high with a trio of releases for Perc including his third EP on CLR, a collaboration with Italy's Modern Heads on Stroboscopic Artefacts and a split 12" with rising star Sawf on Perc Trax.
As a DJ and live act Perc has covered all of Europe plus multiple tours of USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa and Japan. Personal highlights for Perc's touring include a back-to-back set with Oliver Ho in Tokyo, his debut at Tresor in early 2010, being part of the Drumcode tent at Dance Valley in 2008 and playing on the same bill as Richie Hawtin and Speedy J at 2008’s Electric Deluxe Queen’s Day party at Melkweg, Amsterdam.
2011 will see the release of Perc's first album, another tour the USA and Canada and his debut at Berghain.

            <description><![CDATA[With Speedy J. Chris Liebing found the perfect partner in crime for their Live Act project Collabs. Speedy J. is unanimously considered to be one of the first techno producers to come from the Benelux. Speedy J’s musical vision is genre blurring, creative freedom at the highest level of innovation and quality, it is providing a platform for artists operating within any conceivable genre in the broad spectrum of techno to fully explore and embrace the ever-expanding technological possibilities. Blurring the lines between Live performance and Digital Djing, Speedy J. fuses subversive electronics and peak time Techno. Together with Chris Liebing he started using Traktor and other Software technology on 4 laptops with hardware such as Machine Drum and 303’s to create a fully integrated set. Not only setting the bar for peak hour Techno madness, Electric Deluxe becomes the platform for his Collabs series that started on Novamute Collabs present futuristic sounds with hard bass drum, dark and timpulsive. At present the best in the matter of Techno!

Queensnight in Amsterdam offered a rare opportunity to indulge in a seven hour session of Collabs, during the 11th edition of the infamous Electric Deluxe Party. Host and co-organiser Speedy J played an all nighter together with Chris Liebing, shaking the foundations of the famous Amsterdam club Melkweg. Check Video footage here.  ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A product of Sweden’s seemingly endless conveyor of techno talent, Ida Engberg has carved herself a career as a DJ/Producer in the traditional way, through relentless hard work and passion. Her profile has risen steadily over the past few years without hype or fuss, with just her unique take on stripped grooves and heads down, sweat on the ceiling tech-house providing the driving force behind her career progression. 

Ida’s 2007 ‘Disco Volante’ on Pickadoll label put Ida’s name out there to a global audience and brought with it further production success with a series of follow up singles for Pickadoll and key tastemaker label, Get Physical. Currently back in the studio her latest EP, Owl’s Nest, has been picked up by Adam Beyer’s Truesoul imprint and is out now. 

Ida can be found playing her brand of minimal techno and tech house in clubs all over the world every weekend. 2010 has seen Ida rock parties at Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Exit Festival Serbia, Tomorrowland Belgium, Dance Valley Amsterdam, Miami’s Sunday School for Degenerates, Cocoon Frankfurt, Yes at Watergate Berlin, Awakenings Amsterdam, Rote Sonne Munich, U60311 Frankfurt, Catwalk Rotterdam and Op Art Portugal as well as touring with Adam Beyer on Drumcode events in Berlin, Tokyo, London, Ibiza, Milan, Barcelona, Amsterdam, New York, San Francisco and Mexico City.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[DJ/producer Drumcell is co-founder of the popular Los Angeles based techno collective Droid Collective and one of the scene's biggest champions of an emerging hard, lean American minimal sound. His sound is a combination of needles-in-the-red aggressiveness coupled to an austere framework of dark electronic funk. An avowed technologist, Drumcell brings together the best elements of live performance and a traditional DJ set by exploiting recent breakthroughs in both software and mixer technology. His collaboration with Audio Injection entitled "Cell Injection" caught the attention of many DJ tastemakers including Speedy J and Richie Hawtin, signalling that the international community has now caught on to this new American sound. This fact, along with main stage performances at the Movement Festival in Detroit, are growing proof that Drumcell is poised to become the artist to watch in 2011.]]></description>

            <title>CLR Podcast | 112 | Brian Sanhaji (Live)</title>
            <description><![CDATA[When Brian the young innovator, came across a music program on a friend´s Amiga 500, the desire to produce his own sound started to grow within. In the beginning he experimented with Hip Hop beats, but triggered by a “The Prodigy” gig he started focusing more and more on Techno. As much as for many of his contemporaries in the nineties, the legendary “Omen” club in Frankfurt served as a source of inspiration for him. His first two records under the pseudonym “Relic” were released on the label “Triebtäter” in 2000 and 2001. 
After this he took the next step and founded his own label “Enable Recordings”, on which he presents artists like “The Advent” or Andre Walter, next to his own productions. 
Little by little, Brian got the opportunity to release on further labels as well, for instance “Punkt Music” or “Definition Records”. At the same time he produced the project “Citizen Art” together with the artist ”Cess”, and amongst others released a remix for “The Horrorist” on “Things To Come”. 
But ultimately they were his own releases that turned him into a much requested live act. In the course of his transfer to CLR Booking in 2005, his booking schedule increased from the main floor of “Nature One”, to the “Detroit Electronic Music Festival” in the States to his preliminary peak at “Spinclub” / Ibiza. Next to his well-established label “Enable Recordings”, he founded another imprint called “Sonata Music” in the beginning of 2008. Although it was planned as a digital only label, he started releasing the tracks on vinyl as well, due to the big success. 
In October 2008, the album prerelease single “Cortosis” came out, together with a remix by Chris Liebing. In November 2008, the long awaited first Studio album “Stereotype” was finally released on his all-time favorite Techno label CLR. “A stylistically versatile, entirely club oriented record with traces of Minimal, House and Dub, always true to its Techno origins.” 
When Brian is not touring as a live act, or producing new tracks and remixes, he is also working as highly successful mastering technician with clients like CLR and Cocoon Recordings.

            <description><![CDATA[Since 1998, Dustin Zahn has been carefully honing his craft as a producer and DJ.

As a DJ, his moody and hypnotic genre-bending extended sets have him playing everywhere from sun-soaked beach clubs in the Caribbean to dark & cavernous venues in Berlin. There is no further information about Dustin Zahn that has been made public.

            <description><![CDATA[Since being introduced to electronic music back in the early 90's, Audio Injection has been hooked. At the early age of 15 he started Djing and playing out at local underground events and raves around the Southern California area. You would find him spinning various styles from house, acid, & techno to hardcore techno.
After years of Djing he then decided to learn to produce his own music, which landed him releases on techno labels such as Monoid, Stimulus, & local label Droid Recordings. Since being associated with local event production group Droid Behavior in 2003, you can find him as a resident at the infamous Interface warehouse events as well as a regular producer for Droid Recordings along with Drumcell (Co-Founder of Droid Behavior).
With releases & remixes on labels such as Droid, 4 Track, Circle Music , Tora Tora Tora, Smallroom Music, Lazerslut, Enemy Records, Prosthetic Pressings, Timefog, Phobiq, Impact Mechanics, Railyard, CLR and many more to come, Audio Injection continues to shape his own sound as well as collaborate with Drumcell to release more mind bending techno, putting Los Angeles & Droid Recordings on the techno map.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 108 | Tommy Four Seven</title>
            <description><![CDATA[British born, Berlin based DJ, producer and sound designer Tommy Four Seven,
or known to some as just T47, is at the front of the new generation of
Techno artists, creating his trademark deep and uncompromising sounds.
Learning to DJ from a young age, at 17, Tommy held a 2 year residency at
Fire Club, London whilst appearing at legendary venues such as Fabric, The
End and Turnmills.  Producing was also an early interest and Tommy soon
began releasing on David Duriez's, Brique Rouge and Kill Brique label,
before launching his own imprint called Shooting Elvis.
After studying Music Technology in London, Tommy moved to Berlin and has
been steadily building his catalogue of strong, moody and hypnotic tracks
such as his 2009 hit, 'Surma' on Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe and more
recently, 'Sor' on CLR, not forgetting the before mysterious 'Bauhaus'
project with Chris Liebing.
Tommy’s approach to music is unlike a musician. Instead, he prefers to sound
design, recording and sculpting elements into deep engaging atmospheres. An
impressive example of this extraordinary production ethos is his upcoming
debut artist album “Primate”. It will be released on CLR in March 2011,
which looks set to be his landmark year.

            <description><![CDATA[Monoloc based in Germany/Frankfurt am Main started to produce his first sounds in 2001. 
A few years later he moved to a proper studio to ziro in on his music productions. 
The new place and his inspiring studio neighbors created a perfect environment so that he was able to upgrade his skills increasingly. Monoloc´s vinyl debut came in October 2008 with the „In a Haze EP“(Smallroom01)“. 
He released already on labels like CLR, Synewave, MultiVitamins, Micro.fon and Droid for example who get thrilled by his deep minimalistic techno sound consists of organic and sometimes dark vocal elements. His keen sense for good sound let him always know how to produce tracks with his special personal touch or how to create a great ambiance for the dancefloor. His music is slow, dark, enegry and danceable. Mid year 2008 he was ready to take it to the next level and founded his own 
label Smallroom Music. Artists like Maetrik, Alexi Delano, Elon, Ascion, Kane Roth, Mike Wall, Jan Hendez, Brian Sanhaji, Emerson, Matt Star, Jon Seber and many more had released on his emerging label yet. As a label head he has focused till now on discovering fresh and innovative young talent artists. Monoloc is actually touring all around, visiting the best clubs of the scene. Above all festivals like Nature One, Rave on Snow, Day & Night, Ruhr in Love, Dom Mladih (Sarajevo) to name few. 
His DJ sets can be described as pumping and Deep. 
He has a string of E.P‘s and remixes lined up and has no intentions of slowing down!

            <title>CLR Podcast | 106 | Joel Mull</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Joel Mull is a rare breed amongst electronic music producers. Classically trained on the piano from a young age, Joel’s musical understanding goes beyond the traditional primal dancefloor dynamics often associated with techno. Having been bitten by the techno bug before he left school, his career in music began in 1993, and has been moving upwards ever-since, projecting his soulful slant on the techno blueprint and in the process providing the more musical, emotive ying to the colder, percussive yang of traditional techno. As such Joel occupies a special place within the scene, respected for not just his forward-thinking musical output and long, winding sets of deep and melodic tones but also for being a hard-working professional who has spent his time well, progressively working his way up the techno ladder with a consistent, clearly defined musical style.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 103 | Alex Bau</title>
            <description><![CDATA[today’s electronic dance music. His versatile and effective production technique has gained him a long list of releases on various renowned labels. 
There are not many djs of this type. Djs who believed in Techno from the first minute, djs who experienced Techno from the very beginning, djs who made Techno their own thing. Djs who found their own style, even more, who developed it over the years, djs who´s name is the expression for a specific sound. Alex Bau is one of them. Why focusing on just one style of music? Why only minimal sounds? Why only Techno? Why? If you can have it all… 
There has been a time before Techno for Alex Bau. Thousands of records in his collection, different styles, different music, for sure something that leaves its marks, no doubt about it. Still he is doing Depeche Mode-Nights from time to time, just for fun, and his activities on Techno doesn`t really suffer from that, not at all! With his 5 or even more hours sets at his first resident club the „Libella“ in his south-east-bavarian home-area, where for example also DJ Hell started his career back in the 80ies, he achieved the reputation as somebody who is totally aware of what he is doing, totally dedicated to it and also totally loving it. He had his own radio show for over 2 years on a local radio station, still so far the only Techno show in this area. After countless gigs at local clubs, he also started to play at other places all over the planet and continues doing so. Techno can do a lot, if you let it do so. That`s the credo. His credo.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 102 | Tim Xavier</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Tim Xavier's passion for music has kept him on the forefront of techno since
his innovative releases on Blueline in Chicago a decade ago. His career
began in Houston in the 90s, and then on to Chicago, Brooklyn and now
Berlin, where he has resided since 2007. He is a veteran to the industry;
and his dark, edgy production style has remained uncompromised through the
ever changing genres of techno and house. He is also the owner and chief
engineer at Manmade Mastering in Berlin; and this sleepy-eyed coffee addict
defines cool as he cuts master plates for many respected record labels.
Tim’s music has been charted and played by leading artists around the world,
and he has worked with many labels such as Cocoon, Minus, Sci-Tec, Podium,
Timefog, Little Helpers, Sleaze, Droid Behavior and many more. He is also
the owner of his own imprint, LTD400, which encompasses his irresistible
combination of quirk, funk, space and drive. Tim spray-paints his signature
icon on 400 sleeves of each release, a process that he says connects him
more closely to his music and audience. He also works with partner Camea on
her imprint Clink Recordings, with Tony Rohr as the ‘Afternoon Coffee Boys’.
On Stage, Tim’s current performances include a mixture of DJing, Live and
Effects manipulation, carrying out his visionas he sees fit. He creates a
unique experience with his maximal sound quality and music selection, in
which he combines loops and pieces from his own production. He is regularly
on tour and performing across the globe, capturing his audiences with his
signature sound. Tim's relentless devotion to providing cutting edge audio
continues to keep him on the forefront of innovative dance music, and as he
continues to grow it is apparent that we have still yet to see the best of
his work.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 101 | Jonas Kopp</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Jonas Kopp was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1981. His career as a producer was launched when he was 19 years old. After seven years of hard work we find one of the most representative argentine talents for the House and techno global scene.
Jonas is very well depicted by the constant hypnotic flavour in his tracks, the techno arrangements, deep basslines that really fill the surrounding space, the use of effects like reverb ,delays and LFO’s and his faithful attachment to his Detroit and Chicago roots as creative influences .
His live performances are two hours of plenty of hipnotic groove, creating different states all along the set. His DJ sets are a perfect analog-digital fusion.
He founded Traut Muzik, a Label in which he curates the best techno and House artists from the argentine and global techno scene.
Jonas has been releasing in labels like Ostgut Ton , Stroboscopic Artefacts , Curle Recordings , Spectral Sound and his own label Traut Muzik among others.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 100 | Chris Liebing</title>
            <description><![CDATA[On December 10th 2010, a remarkable event took place in Frankfurt. Chris Liebing and his CLR crew, consisting of Tommy Four Seven, Brian Sanhaji (live) and Monoloc, for the first time ever hosted a night at the Cocoon Club. It was not only the first CLR Party in Chris Liebing´s home base for a very long time, but also his birthday. 
After all the requests Chris decided to publish this set especially fort he 100th edition of our podcast. recorded live with the ambience of the frenetic crowd and the packed club. unfortunately we can not provide a tracklist this time. Chris Liebing is a Techno pioneer, dj, producer, CLR podcast host, radio host and the driving force behind CLR. He has been one of the first djs who fully embraced the digital age of music. Since then he has never stopped working on his dj and production setup’s and has finally reached a point of complete satisfaction with his technical and artistic possibilities.  2009 was a year of many changes for CLR. Chris Liebing and his team celebrated the 10th anniversary of CLR, restructured the label, opened an office in Berlin and celebrated many great parties on Chris´ club- and festival gigs. The residency at the BE nights at Space / Ibiza became a big success. In the beginning of the year, Chris had begun with the production of the weekly CLR podcast, which by now counts more than 250.000 monthly listeners. He officially renamed CLR into CREATE LEARN REALIZE (as this is what he did most of his life) and by doing so he finally got rid of his ego in the label name. 2010 CLR started off with a new distribution by Word And Sound. The first common project was the 10 Years CLR Compilation with 10 exclusive tracks by some of the finest techno producers of our time. Chris and his team is looking forward for all upcoming projects in 2011...]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Pfirter is one of the main icons of the electronic scene in South America. After more than a decade of a solid career, Juan Pablo has developed a very unique and personal style, mainly because of his very particular set, based on many subgenres of Techno. 
Pfirter is nowadays considered one of the argentinian djs with the biggest international projection, with releases on labels as CLR, Stockholm Ltd, Figure, Synewave and his own music plattform, MindTrip Music, among others. 
This records are played and charted by artists like Sven Vath, Richie Hawtin, Par Grindvik, Chris Liebing, Speedy J, Chris Fortier, Christian Smith, Xpansul, Joey Beltram, Kevin Gorman, Michael Mayer and many more.
All of this, allows him to perform nowadays in the best clubs in Argentina and South America (Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Venezuela, Ecuador...). And he performs regularly in Europe, on clubs such as Berghain (Berlin), The End (London) or Club4 (Barcelona).

            <title>CLR Podcast | 097 | Sebrok</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Given what a vibrant and dense electronic music scene Berlin has, it's not easy to make yourself stand out from the crowd as a producer and to break out of the city's insular musical bubble. But such widescreen, mind-bending and sophisticated techno as that of local hotshot Sebrok was never going to go unnoticed on a wider scale.
Steadily rising through the ranks of the techno fraternity, Sebrok's ascent began in 2004 when he founded his own label PASO Music with fellow Teutonic talent Marc Miroir. He soon found his records getting love from electronic royalty such as Laurent Garnier, DJ Hell and Sven Väth, and as techno gradually came back into favour with crowds around the world over the next few years, his increasingly impressive productions started to pop up in more and more high profile places. David Squillace's MiniSketch label, Dubfire's scene-leading Sci+Tec, Nic Fanciulli's Global Underground compilation – all undoubted hallmarks of quality and cool. After years of grinding away and a risking everything (he ditched his successful job at MTV Networks to work on his creative passions) his gamble has quite clearly paid off. Alongside his role as one of the founders of hugely successful fashion label German Garment, he is widely recognised as one of the world's most talented up and coming techno producers.
Flying in the face of dumb, thoughtless dancefloor fodder, his tracks are constructed with intricate technical trickery, making your brain do aural double-takes as his carefully crafted grooves thump against your bones. It's music that ebbs and flows, grows and pulsates throughout its course and rewards those who give it their full time and attention. 
The proof is in the pudding though, as they say, and Sebrok will soon serve up his just desserts in the form of his debut album The Pain. “I always wanted to do an album” he explains, “but during my time at MTV, it was impossible to think about spending so much time making music. But as soon as i quit, the idea popped up again and I started working on it, which took me now all in all over a year.” He'll be releasing it on his beloved PASO Music, with 14 tracks spread thick over two discs, displaying both his production and remix skills – from hard-hitting thumpers to Balearic-tinged ethereal moments and even a daring fusion of techno and indie with German outfit Northern Lite. 
His latest PASO 12” comes with remixes from the hugely respected Steve Lawler and Mobilee Mastermind Anja Schneider, while his recent Ideal Audio is going down a storm with everyone from Josh Wink to  Marc Romboy to Laurent Garnier. With the support of everyone who's anyone in techno music, Sebrok's star looks set to continue to rise throughout the decade. Dance music by numbers this ain't.

            <itunes:subtitle>Chris Liebing presents the CLR Podcast 095 with Gary Beck</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>It was only a matter of time before one of Scotlands leading young techno producers burst onto the worldwide underground dance scene.
His first release on Philladelphia's 'Worship Recordings' label in 2005 was only the beginning for this talanted artist, as In 2008, Ritchie Hawtin's 'Minus' signed the massive 'consumed', and Gary has never looked back.
His deep but fresh quirky style is in demand from Glasgow, to Tokyo and all over Europe, and is well respected for the party atmosphere he creates.
Gary can count on support from many of the biggest names in Techno, including Josh Wink, Dubfire, Chris Liebing, Len Faki, Slam &amp; Richie Hawtin.
His style can be heard on labels such as Soma, Edit Select, Saved, Figure and many more. He is always in high demand for remixes, and has recently remixed for artists such as Christian Smith, Audio Soul Project &amp; Mark Broom. Gary is also working on new material for his own imprint 'Bek-Audio', which is fast approaching it's 5th release.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 094 | Kyle Geiger</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Hailing from a region known for its basketball and corn, the emergence of an artist from Indiana such as Kyle Geiger is marked as seldom at best.  Kyle Geiger's quick rise in the international dance scene is due to both his production prowess, and his explosive decks and effects DJ sets that bridge the divide between techno and minimal. Kyle is not a producer first, DJ second, but chooses to look at both aspects of DJ and production as a whole; one is not complete without the other. Originally inspired by the harder, percussive stylings of late 90's Swedish techno featured on seminal labels like Drumcode and Code Red, Kyle has witnessed the evolution of the genre as it morphed into a more accessible, groove based sound. Still loving the energy and power of the earlier phases of techno while embracing the genre's changes, Kyle has refined his productions and DJ sets into what very well may be a new breed of soundscapes that pushes things forward for the next generation of techno to come.  With highly regarded releases on Drumcode, MB Elektronics, and Perc Trax, as well as remixes for Trapez, Droid, Renovatio, plus having his tracks played by all the heavy hitters, the future is proving to be a very promising place for Kyle Geiger as he continues to take his widely recognized DJ set around the world and to the next level.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 093 | Surgeon</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Surgeon, real name Anthony Child, has been at the forefront of UK techno since the 1995.
His debut EP is regarded by many as seminal, launching his career along with several early Downwards releases, causing a ripple of excitement through the techno cognoscenti of the time. Surgeon has been prolific since, with three albums on Tresor and numerous Counterbalance and Dynamic Tension EPs. “Over the course of his career, the Birmingham resident has perfected a unique and uncommonly effective production style. His is a tough techno sound with an industrial murk about it but also plenty of funk, swing and a sophisticated sense of dub-space learned in part from his Chain Reaction contemporaries in Berlin. Proving that hard can also be smart, sensuous and danceable, the influence of Surgeon on the 2010-ruling Ostgut/Berghain sound – DJs/producers like Marcel Dettmann, Shed et al – is substantial”. (Fact Magazine)
Further evidence of these multi-functional production skills can be seen on Surgeon's impressive remix CV, working with the biggest names in techno (Dave Clarke, Luke Slater/PAS, Green Velvet, Hardfloor, the Black Dog etc), Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Glasgow post-rock outfit Mogwai, old masters Faust and Coil, and most recently, artists such Moderat, Shed, Traversable Wormhole and Scuba.
Recently dubbed by Fact magazine as “arguably the finest techno DJ in the world”, Surgeon is also naturally one of the most in-demand, with recent mixes for Warp and Fabric and a schedule spread across Europe, U.S.A and Japan. He has played every key club/event/festival going; helped pioneer Birmingham’s House of God; and, held a 3 year residency at Tresor (Berlin) during its all powerful 1990s peak. Surgeon continues to operate with Ben Sims as Frequency 7, whilst he was also one half of the much loved British Murder Boys (with Regis of Sandwell District).
Contemporary Surgeon sets are notable for experimentation with new DJ technologies embracing cutting edge hardware and software solutions, increasingly blurring the line between a DJ set and a live performance. Surgeon is a selector of some skill and one of the most inventive, intuitive users of Ableton out there. Using techno as a vehicle to carry his artistic message, he also mixes up everything from contemporary bass music/dubstep to Rephlex-esque electronica to create a coherent and intense whole.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 092 | Xhin</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Xhin (pronounced as "sheen") has been crafting ominous cuts of cutting-edge electronic music since 1997. Building a forte in sound design, he is best described as a sound futurist. His identical rhythmic structure and compositional techniques which incorporate elements of techno, tight sub bass, ambient and IDM delivers a hint of chaotic soundscape amidst artistry. A Singaporean by birth and residence, he independently released "Xycle", a self-promotional ep that made the industry to stand up to take notice, in early 2003. He then followed with his debut album, "Supersonicstate" the following year.
In 2006, his talent has been discovered by a German independent record label Meerestief. With a remix for Five Green Circle's track entitled Ronan's BBQ has created a storm over Europe, fully supported and charted by heavy weights from the world of electronic music.
An active DJ in the Singapore club culture he has played extensively in a number of clubs and various events like ZoukOut, Good Vibrations, Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festival, Singapore Fashion Festival and for fashion label Woods & Woods runways. In 2007, Xhin was invited to play at the important electronic music festival, C/O Pop in Cologne Germany and the first outdoor electronic music festival in Hanoi, together with various good acts from the far east.
Besides releasing and remixing, Xhin also got involved in various miscellaneous projects like producing music and sounds for Nike, Nokia and fashion label like Woods & Woods among others. He also appeared as a special guest tutor on electronic music production using Ableton Live for Red Bull Music Academy Info Sessions II in Singapore.
In 2009, Xhin joined Berlin's new techno label, Stroboscopic Artefacts to release his dark, intense and experimental sounds. From the results of his new releases for the label, he has done it again. Heavy rotation from the big boys like Speedy J, Luke Slater, Ben Klock and many more. This will be yet again the beginning of an old new direction for him to explore and experiment sounds even deeper for his future releases.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 090 | Terence Fixmer</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Terence Fixmer is one of France’s most illustrated characters of the techno scene, of which he has been at the forefront for over 10 successful years. Bringing his dark, atmospheric sound to prestigious dance floors that range from Berlin’s mecca of techno to Paris ‘ Rex club. Equally at ease in the club or at a pure techno festival, Terence reached this respected level, without ever succumbing to excessive promotion or subscribing to the mainstream. Terence Fixmer’s sound, which deftly avoids repetition by developing soundscapes that appeals to the club crowd, whilst still maintaining musical depth and integrity. Sombre, defined by surging rhythmical structures, Terence’s music appeals as much to dancingfeet, as it does to the searching soul. He above all preserves an original style, an increasingly experimental, simultaneously ruthless and unrelenting interpretation of modern Techno, instantly recognizable.
With his new lonplayer ‘Comedy Of Menace’ Terence Fixmer created a true techno album, with an instantly recognizable pure sound and a deep and dark atmosphere throughout. The Album is, in many ways, hypnotizing and mental, yet keeps the energy and effectiveness for the dancefloor. 
Besides the Album release in September, the EP 'Comedy Of Menace pt1.’ will be released with a Planetary Assault System mix. New remixes done for Niederflur, for Traversable Wormhole on Chris Liebing’s CLR and Echologist aka Brendon Moeller will appear in the coming months. On Top, his EP on Tiga’s Turbo will hit in november .
In summary: Two solo albums on Gigolo, DJ Hell’s mythical Munich-based label; the seminal “Muscle Machine” (1999) that single-handedly spearheaded a new style, “techno body music” (a unique combination of modern techno and EBM of the founding fathers from Nitzer Ebb to Front 242); copious maxis on prestigious labels, such as Gigolo, Novamute, Datapunk, Different, Music Man; and remixes for various techno gods, from Sven Väth to Dave Clarke, DJ Hell, Speedy J & Radio Slave...

            <title>CLR Podcast | 089 | Tommy Four Seven</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Dark, raw and sweaty environments are where you’re most likely to find Tommy Four Seven, filling the void between house and techno since 2005.
Tommy’s been steadily building his catalogue of strong, moody and hypnotic dancefloor destroyers such as early hits on Parisian label, Kill Brique and recent recordings for Wolfskuil Records, Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe and Chris Liebing’s CLR, as well as remixes for the likes of Josh Wink and Darko Esser.
Tommy’s approach to music is unlike a musician. Instead, Tommy prefers to sound design, recording and sculpting elements into deep engaging atmospheres. It’s this production ethos Tommy also applies in the club, morphing from tech-house, to the darker realms of techno. “I always keep the foundations deep and hypnotic, a vibe I feel that creates more of a connection.”
Giving his own contribution to techno, in 2008 Tommy launched deep techno imprint, Shooting Elvis. Gathering artists from Mark Broom to Remute, to Sebastian Roya to James Kronier, choosing to release quality rather than quantity, an attitude that has not gone unnoticed with supporters including Ben Klock, Len Faki, Joel Mull and Paco Osuna.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 088 | Function</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Function, aka David Sumner, should be a familiar name to anyone who's been paying attention to techno in New York City for the past 15+ years. Heavily influence by the early New York rave scene (Limelight, NASA, Storm, etc), Dave dove into production with a string of releases and collaborations on Damon Wild's seminal Synewave label in the mid-90s. From the late 90s to the early 00s, Function put out many productions on his own label, Infrastructure. In the process he made a strong artistic connection with Regis and Female from the UK, and formed Portion Reform with Regis, releasing a handful of 12"s and an album on the cult, UK Midlands based imprint, Downwards. This connection remains strong to this day. In 2008, Dave moved to Berlin and began to strongly focus on the Sandwell District label, which was undoubtedly one of the breakout labels that year. The label was launched in 2002, and has only put out 15 releases since then, each one well worth owning. In 2010, the techno spotlight is shining brightly on Sumner and Sandwell. He has a residency at Berghain, and appears regularly at other huge clubs around Europe, and from all reports, his performance was the best set at the Labyrinth Festival in Japan this year. And now with Sandwell District being slated to close the main stage at Sonar this June, 2 new groundbreaking V/A Promo 12"s in the pipeline set to come out in May/June 2010, which will precede a full length Sandwell District album and 2 new collaborative projects with Jerome Sydenham for CLR and Ibadan, the future really couldn't be much brighter.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 087 | James Ruskin</title>
            <description><![CDATA[James Ruskin is one of the leading lights in UK techno. With a musical
history that can be traced back to mid-80s electro and hip-hop, Ruskin
brings a long background and deep knowledge of underground electronic music
to his productions and DJing.
When Detroit techno emerged in the UK at the start of the 90s, Ruskin bought
all the key records and started to DJ soon afterwards but quickly realised
that he needed to make how own music to gain recognition.
Subsequently, Ruskin and long-time friend Richard Polson set up a studio
together and, by 1996, had also launched a label, Blueprint (a sub-label,
Coda, followed in 2000).
Originally working together as Outline, Polson and Ruskin’s first searing
interpretations of minimalism formed part of a new wave of UK techno
producers alongside Birmingham’s Surgeon and Regis, and London’s Oliver Ho.
By 1998, having released a number of solo EPs and collaborative works with
Polson, Ruskin put out his debut album, ‘Further Design’ on Blueprint.
‘Design’, along with the rest of his work on Blueprint, mean't that in a
short space of time Ruskin became one of the World’s most in-demand techno
DJs.
One of the clubs that James started to play in most regularly was Berlin’s
Tresor, where he first performed at his friend Surgeon’s residency. Through
this connection, Ruskin was asked to deliver his second album for the label
of the same name. 2000’s ‘Point 2’ saw Ruskin deliver chilling ambience,
ferocious, dense club tracks, the
Detroit funk of ‘Connected’ and the symphonic strings of ‘Detached’. A more
rounded affair than his debut long-played, Ruskin quickly followed ‘Point 2’
with ‘Into Submission’ the next year. A denser, brooding but occasionally
melodic and emotive affair, it saw the UK producer moving further from his
purist roots. 
James’ most recent album, last year’s ‘The Dash’ was melancholic and
melodic, often understated but never lightweight, Ruskin explored with a
variety of tempos and beat structures on ‘The Dash’ and its his best long
player to date. 
Against this backdrop, Ruskin has re-launched Blueprint with the first
release proper from his new collaborative project, O/V/R, together with
Regis aka Karl O’Connor.

Tresor, where he first performed at his friend Surgeon’s residency. Through
this connection, Ruskin was asked to deliver his second album for the label
of the same name. 2000’s ‘Point 2’ saw Ruskin deliver chilling ambience,
ferocious, dense club tracks, the
Detroit funk of ‘Connected’ and the symphonic strings of ‘Detached’. A more
rounded affair than his debut long-played, Ruskin quickly followed ‘Point 2’
with ‘Into Submission’ the next year. A denser, brooding but occasionally
melodic and emotive affair, it saw the UK producer moving further from his
purist roots. 
James’ most recent album, last year’s ‘The Dash’ was melancholic and
melodic, often understated but never lightweight, Ruskin explored with a
variety of tempos and beat structures on ‘The Dash’ and its his best long
player to date. 
Against this backdrop, Ruskin has re-launched Blueprint with the first
release proper from his new collaborative project, O/V/R, together with
Regis aka Karl O’Connor.

            <description><![CDATA[Cari Lekebusch

Cari Lekebusch is a Stockholm-based sound architect alongsides other Swedish Techno profiles like Adam Beyer, Joel Mull, Alexi Delano and Jesper Dahlbäck. He has borne many pseudonyms over the course of his illustrious career to date including Fred, Mr Barth, Braincell, Shape Changer, Vector, and The Mantis to name a select few.  In addition to being a celebrated DJ and producer, in the mid-nineties Cari also launched his inaugural label – Hybrid Sound Architectures (a.k.a. H-Prod) and has since added Kaun Trax, Djupt, Audio Mekanixc, KGB, Trainspotters Nightmare, Audio Pollution and Grundtakt to his growing family of labels.

After close to two decades in this highly competitive industry, Cari’s success is hardly ephemeral. He has been invited to perform regularly at many of the highest profile techno clubs and events around the globe, including Awakenings, Fuse, Tresor, Fabric, Berghain, Omen, E-Werk, U60311, The End, Fabrik, Rex Club, Liquid Room, F135, Rohstofflager, plus well-known festivals/big events such as I Love Techno, Time Warp, May Day, Awakenings and Nature One.  

An impressive repertoire of releases to date have materialized from his studio and permeated into the crates of the global electronic music community. His work has been featured on a myriad of labels over the years including releases on Swedish imprints such as Drumcode, Code Red, Truesoul, Jericho and Corb, plus tracks on other prominent labels including Novamute, Soma, Primevil, Masters of Disaster, Fine Audio Recording, Harthouse, Mote-Evolver and Turbo to name a few. 

Cari will undoubtedly continue to make his mark in the electronic music industry for years to come with the quiet confidence he has exuded throughout his career.

With Mike Dehnert (Fachwerk Records, Berlin) we are presenting one of the currently most interesting Modern Techno Music producers. He is founder of the label Fachwerk Records on which he is publishing under his own name. His Live Acts and DJ Sets are as remarkable as his productions and you won‘t ever hear him playing any self-pleasing or incidental grooves. Mostly Mike is playing his own unpublished tracks. He did just put his ability to the test within collabarations with Clone rec and the Clone Basemnet Series. On the super limited MD2 Series Mike Dehnert is presenting again his variety in music.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 081 | Marc Romboy</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Marc Romboy

Music with a certain break dance appeal - reminiscent of old school Chicago dance floor insanity - is Marc Romboy’s true passion. Working in dance music for over a decade, Romboy has co-founded and built internationally respected dance-music labels and projects, never tiring of coming up with fresh and innovative ideas to push the limits of electronic sounds.  In 1994, Romboy and Klaus Derichs founded their own label ‘Le Petit Prince’. The label quickly became one of Germany’s most popularunderground outputs, with Groove magazine charting it as the second most popular label in 1995. It went on to release tracks from Microwave Prince, Emmanuel Top, Thomas P. Heckmann and Phuture until its demise in 2000. Around the same time as he formed Le Petit Prince, Romboy also began djing, frequently playing at the techno parties. Now, Romboy regularly travels around the globe at clubs including The Rex in Paris, The End in London, Watergate and Weekend in Berlin, F.U.S.E. in Brussels, Cocorico in Italy and Cocoon and Monza in Frankfurt. “Basically I love to dj all over the globe because I like the way that everybody understands and lives the same language, the universal language of techno or house music.” Romboy began his second label Systematic in 2004, he also released his debut artist album ‘Gemini’ on the label in 2006 to great critical acclaim. Through both his solo releases and his collaborations, Romboy has also released on labels including Ovum, Simple, Brique Rouge, Superstition, 20:20 Vision and more. A regular collaboration is that with Romboy and Stephan Bodzin, the two have released records together on Systematic, 20:20 Vision and Bodzin’s own imprint Herzblut, with ‘Atlas’ and ‘Callisto’, being two of their biggest releases so far. “All my other collaborations have been done with singers as I love to include the soul caused by the voice in electronic music; it’s definately my style and passion, soulful techno and house.” In june 2008 Romboy released his second artist album on Systematic called ‘Contrast’, produced in cooperation with his friends and studio mates 45 Rocks.
In 2009 he wanted to have his focus on playing a lot of different shows around the world, tours in Australia, North America and Europe. They finally launched their own weekly radio show called ‘Systematic Sessions’. Besides this he was happy to have mixed the ‘Essential Mix’ on BBC Radio One in march 2009, a great occasion to represent high quality tech house to a huge audience.”

            <itunes:summary>Marc Romboy

Music with a certain break dance appeal - reminiscent of old school Chicago dance floor insanity - is Marc Romboy’s true passion. Working in dance music for over a decade, Romboy has co-founded and built internationally respected dance-music labels and projects, never tiring of coming up with fresh and innovative ideas to push the limits of electronic sounds.  In 1994, Romboy and Klaus Derichs founded their own label ‘Le Petit Prince’. The label quickly became one of Germany’s most popularunderground outputs, with Groove magazine charting it as the second most popular label in 1995. It went on to release tracks from Microwave Prince, Emmanuel Top, Thomas P. Heckmann and Phuture until its demise in 2000. Around the same time as he formed Le Petit Prince, Romboy also began djing, frequently playing at the techno parties. Now, Romboy regularly travels around the globe at clubs including The Rex in Paris, The End in London, Watergate and Weekend in Berlin, F.U.S.E. in Brussels, Cocorico in Italy and Cocoon and Monza in Frankfurt. “Basically I love to dj all over the globe because I like the way that everybody understands and lives the same language, the universal language of techno or house music.” Romboy began his second label Systematic in 2004, he also released his debut artist album ‘Gemini’ on the label in 2006 to great critical acclaim. Through both his solo releases and his collaborations, Romboy has also released on labels including Ovum, Simple, Brique Rouge, Superstition, 20:20 Vision and more. A regular collaboration is that with Romboy and Stephan Bodzin, the two have released records together on Systematic, 20:20 Vision and Bodzin’s own imprint Herzblut, with ‘Atlas’ and ‘Callisto’, being two of their biggest releases so far. “All my other collaborations have been done with singers as I love to include the soul caused by the voice in electronic music; it’s definately my style and passion, soulful techno and house.” In june 2008 Romboy released his second artist album on Systematic called ‘Contrast’, produced in cooperation with his friends and studio mates 45 Rocks.

            <description><![CDATA[Perc

From his earliest demos to his current position as a key figure in the global techno scene, Perc (aka Ali Wells) has taken the established forms of the music he loves and twisted them into something new and fresh. Building up successful relationships with scene-leading labels such as Drumcode, Ovum, Kompakt and CLR whilst unleashing a strong run of releases on his own Perc Trax label has seen Perc’s influence and support grow even further. With each release his sonic experimentation has taken another leap forward without losing sight of the dancefloor.  2009’s ‘Throb’ on Ovum and ‘Submit’ on CLR brought Perc his first support from the key Berlin tastemakers and his 2010 releases including ‘BCG’ (Perc Trax) and ‘Monad V’ (Stroboscopic Artefacts) have made him an essential artist for those with an interest in techno that refuses to conform to preconceptions. As Perc’s profile grows his booking schedule has become busier and Perc’s travels have covered all of Europe plus tours of USA, Canada, Mexico, South Africa and Japan. Personal highlights for Perc's touring include a back-to-back set with Oliver Ho in Tokyo, his debut at Tresor in early 2010, being part of the Drumcode tent at Dance Valley in 2008 and playing on the same bill as Richie Hawtin and Speedy J at 2008’s Electric Deluxe Queen’s Day party at Melkweg, Amsterdam.  This year Perc has frequently played alongside Josh Wink as part of the '15 Years Of Ovum Tour' and will make his debut at Berlin's legendary Panorama Bar in September.

            <description><![CDATA[Phil Kieran

Belfast born Phil Kieran is back once again with a big schedule of quality output and some new labels including his own Phil Kieran recordings. After the mammoth ‘SHH’ debut long player project released on cocoon earlier this year to critical acclaim and a successful world tour, playing his forward thinking live avsets in some of the biggest clubs around, Kieran didnt want to look back and rest on his laurels he decided to jump back into the studio locking himself away for weeks on end putting together a large amount of output to push over to some labels he has been liking for a number of years. From these tracks produced Kieran has signed 3 eps to Snork Enterprises, Electric Deluxe and International DJ Gigolo. This happened very quickly giving him some time to look forward to the next project that he has been wanting to put to bed for a number of years ‘Skyhook’.  Originally never making any remixes of the massive chart smasher he had lots of requests from various people to rework the track. Without having a label to put it out Phil dismissed this as something that he might look at in the future.  The skyhook remixes have been produced by Jesper Dalhback & Adam Beyer, Ricardo Tobar, Scuba Vs SCB, Green Velvet and Felix Martin who you will know from Hot Chip infamy. This is a project put together to kick start his label Phil Kieran Recordings and also finally end the request to re-release Skyhook.

            <itunes:summary>Phil Kieran

Belfast born Phil Kieran is back once again with a big schedule of quality output and some new labels including his own Phil Kieran recordings. After the mammoth ‘SHH’ debut long player project released on cocoon earlier this year to critical acclaim and a successful world tour, playing his forward thinking live avsets in some of the biggest clubs around, Kieran didnt want to look back and rest on his laurels he decided to jump back into the studio locking himself away for weeks on end putting together a large amount of output to push over to some labels he has been liking for a number of years. From these tracks produced Kieran has signed 3 eps to Snork Enterprises, Electric Deluxe and International DJ Gigolo. This happened very quickly giving him some time to look forward to the next project that he has been wanting to put to bed for a number of years ‘Skyhook’.  Originally never making any remixes of the massive chart smasher he had lots of requests from various people to rework the track. Without having a label to put it out Phil dismissed this as something that he might look at in the future.  The skyhook remixes have been produced by Jesper Dalhback &amp; Adam Beyer, Ricardo Tobar, Scuba Vs SCB, Green Velvet and Felix Martin who you will know from Hot Chip infamy. This is a project put together to kick start his label Phil Kieran Recordings and also finally end the request to re-release Skyhook.

Chris Liebing´s first Omen set ever - 24.11.1995

Welcome to this week´s CLR Podcast. Let me take you on a little personal history tour this time. You might know that I am normally more about "new" music, rather than "old" music, or one could say that I am pretty much the wrong DJ to book for a "classics" night, but here I am, very happily making an exception.

A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an old box in my basement. In this box I found a tape (yes, one of these old things with two holes and actual tape on a reel) with a white sticker that showed "Omen 24.11.95" on it. I realized that on this Friday night, almost 15 years ago, I had my very first gig at the famous club. 

At that time I was randomly DJing at little clubs and worked main time for EYE Q Records in Frankfurt, when I was asked by DJ Good Groove (at that time label manager at EYE Q) if I could fill in for DJ Pauli (today label manager of Cocoon Recordings), who suffered a stomach flu. It was Friday afternoon and I was basically the last person to get asked, since all other regular resident DJs didn't have time.
 
Of course I agreed, and lucky for me, the night went so well, that I quickly became a resident at this famous club in the heart of Frankfurt myself. In the last three years of this club (it had to close down in October 1998) I was able to play along some of the finest international guests and also opened various times for Sven and DJ Dag - as well as having my own nights, where I invited artists like for example Adam Beyer or The Advent. 
Looking back to these precious 3 years of my career, I would say it was the best DJ school one could ever ask for. I played warm up sets, long sets, short sets, peak time sets, morning sets and chill in and out sets, all in front of a knowing crowd on one of the best sound systems at that time. 

So it really is quite a discovery, which I made in my basement, and I am happy to be able to share this with you on our CLR Podcast. I am curious what you think. Were the old times really better then today? How much has changed in style and sound? A lot? Nothing? Are we going in circles? Maybe you could send me some feedback on Facebook or Twitter, since we have not yet managed to install a forum on our Website (soon to come…).

Ok, so what you can hear on the published CLR Podcast are 60 min of that tape recording, including some comments of mine. In case you are interested to hear the whole 90 min without my talk, you can download it for free on our website www.clr.net, you just need to register. The set is so old, that I do not think anyone will mind. Sorry about the sound quality at times, but remember the tape is 15 years old.

Now lean back and enjoy - and by the way, in case someone can come up with a complete track listing, that would be very much appreciated :)

Peace and fun,

Chris Liebing

            <title>CLR Podcast | 075 | Peter van Hoesen</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Peter van Hoesen

When it comes down to combining the best of many musical worlds, Peter Van Hoesen can say he's been doing it for a while now. Deeply rooted in the Belgian electronic music scene, he is considered by many as a man with multiple musical talents: from straight-up dancefloor jackin' techno to advanced abstract electronica. He is active as a DJ, producer, composer and sound designer for contemporary dance and theatre. 

Since 2006 Peter has established a reputation for producing solid but thoughtful techno. His productions are mainly released through his own Time To Express imprint. Attention to detail, a healthy obsession with bass and a profound love for the dancefloor are trademark aspects of his work. This was soon picked up by other labels, resulting in releases for Komisch, Curle, Meakusma and Morse. A string of remixes concludes this list, most notably his dark 2009 techno reconstruction of Ed Rush & Optical's seminal tech-step burner 'Defect'. His 2010 album 'Entropic City' was heralded by many as a contemporary classic. 
 
Peter's techno sound is best described as bass-heavy, 6 am warehouse music with a twist. His monthly DJ residency at Brussels' legendary Fuse club showcases this particular take on electronic dance music. With a keen ear for new sounds his musical approach is distinctly forward looking, while staying connected to electronic dance music's rich past.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 073 I Norman Nodge</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Norman Nodge

Norman Nodge is a resident dj at Berghain since 2005. Being a life long music lover, dj and promoter of his own parties all led up to his current status of Berlin’s secret weapon for serious techno. Born in East German Leipzig, raised in Brandenburg, Norman got bitten by the techno bug after the wall came down. From 1994 on he promoted several events, which also helped to launch his career as a dj. At these parties, he crossed paths with Marcel Fengler and Marcel Dettmann for the first time and literally became their mentor for all things techno. At the end of the 90s, Nodge backed out of the local nightlife in order to focus on becoming a lawyer and starting a family. Five years ago, though, Marcel Dettmann pitched him to Berghain’s management and he became a resident instantaneously. Since then, he plays there once a month specialising in the almost forgotten art of warming up at the beginning of a night. In 2005 he also started to produce his own tracks. His maturity proved to be very beneficial in terms of his artistic vision, as he made up his mind about what he likes and what not a long time ago already. Unsurprisingly, his outings on Dettmann’s MDR label, as well as his track „Native Rhythm Electric“ for OstGut Ton left a deep impression with headstrong techno lovers. With his dusty funk, static hiss and the rich thump of his kick drums, he managed to made himself recognised as one of techno’s more unique auteurs. Norman Nodge cites Detroit techno (Jeff Mills, Rob Hood, 430 West), Chicago House (Relief, Dance Mania) and Techno (Luke Slater, Peacefrog, Mark Broom) as his most essential influences. Hence, it is not surprising that he fuses the old with the new, the soft with the tough when he plays out. „It is my goal as a dj to make people dance withought walking on trodden paths of recent trends. I want to sensitize dancers for unusual sounds, old and new.“

            <description><![CDATA[Drumcell

DJ/producer Drumcell is co-founder of the popular Los Angeles based techno collective Droid Collective and one of the scene's biggest champions of an emerging hard, lean American minimal sound. His sound is a combination of needles-in-the-red aggressiveness coupled to an austere framework of dark electronic funk. An avowed technologist, Drumcell brings together the best elements of live performance and a traditional DJ set by exploiting recent breakthroughs in both software and mixer technology. His recent collaboration with Audio Injection entitled "Cell Injection" caught the attention of many DJ tastemakers including Speedy J and Richie Hawtin, signalling that the international community has now caught on to this new American sound. This fact, along with a main stage performance at this year's Movement Festival in Detroit, are growing proof that Drumcell is poised to become the artist to watch in 2010.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Lucy

At 16, Lucy aka Luca Mortellaro embarked on his journey of musical creation, experimenting firstly with analog synths. From these humble beginnings he started performing as a DJ, creating a name for himself as an underground artist in Italy. Once he moved to Paris in 2006 he decided to fully dedicate his life to electronic music. Lucy attracted interest from several labels and in 2007 had his first releases.  Lucy launched his own Techno record label Stroboscopic Artefacts in September 2009, already supported by Speedy J, Luke Slater, Loco Dice, Len Faki, Edit-Select to name but a few. Supported by giants of electronic music such as Joris Voorn, Dj Hell, Steve Lawler, Derrick May, Laurent Garnier, Agoria, James Holden, John Digweed and more, Lucy is confirmed as one of the most interesting newcomers to the underground scene.

            <title>10 Years CLR Special Podcast</title>
            <description><![CDATA[10Y CLR Compilation

Musically, we dive into a universe of relentless, high tech beats and soundscapes. Big bass drops to unveil sexy grooves, massaging the body from belly to fingertips. Hypnotizing patterns and reverb rooms sorround pounding beats and sudden high range attacks.These tracks work like crazy on the floor, and that‘s a proven fact. This is what Techno sounds like on a 2010 technology level, big room and tough but ballsy and slick, functional yet innovative:  Let all hell break loose.

From classic to new, that fits the list of people who contributed, that fits the formats the project is released on. There will be a color series of 5 releases on 10inch vinyl, there will be the classic mix cd, and there will be the digital EPs. 
They‘ll have classic Techno protagonists we know from the last 10 years like Adam Beyer, Alex Bau, Speedy J, Chris Liebing vs. Green Velvet, Function vs. Jerome Sydenham Sanhaji, Monoloc, Pfirter and of course Tommy Four Seven. All artists produced their tracks exclusively for this project, giving it a unique character.
Techno enters its third decade stronger than ever with no end in sight. CLR will help shape that future. Create - Learn - Realize.

For all those who can´t make it to one of the CLR nights tuesdays in June at Space Ibiza: You might want to get hold of a copy or digital download of the 10 YRS CLR Compilation.

            <description><![CDATA[Alan Fitzpatrick
The continued rise of Alan Fitzpatrick is the biggest story in UK techno right now. Tirelessly championed by Dubfire, Len Faki and John Digweed over the last three years it has been Alan’s partnership with Adam Beyer’s Drumcode label that has produced his most significant work; releasing two chart-topping EP’s on the label in the last half of 2009 and ending a monumental year as one of a select handful of producers invited to remix Beyer’s classic Remainings III. With the same unstoppable momentum that characterizes Alan’s style of techno powering demand for his music worldwide, the coming of his debut LP, Shadows In The Dark, on Drumcode marks the start of the next chapter in Alan’s exciting career.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 066 I Tommy Four Seven</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Tommy Four Seven
 Dark, raw and sweaty environments are where you’re most likely to find Tommy Four Seven, filling the void between house and techno since 2005.  Tommy’s been steadily building his catalogue of strong, moody and hypnotic dancefloor destroyers such as early hits on Parisian label, Kill Brique and recent recordings for Wolfskuil Records, Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe and Chris Liebing’s CLR, as well as remixes for the likes of Josh Wink and Darko Esser.  Tommy’s approach to music is unlike a musician. Instead, Tommy prefers to sound design, recording and sculpting elements into deep engaging atmospheres. It’s this production ethos Tommy also applies in the club, morphing from tech-house, to the darker realms of techno. “I always keep the foundations deep and hypnotic, a vibe I feel that creates more of a connection.”  Giving his own contribution to techno, in 2008 Tommy launched deep techno imprint, Shooting Elvis. Gathering artists from Mark Broom to Remute, to Sebastian Roya to James Kronier, choosing to release quality rather than quantity, an attitude that has not gone unnoticed.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 063 I Brian Sanhaji</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Brian Sanhaji

When Brian the young innovator, came across a music program on a friend´s Amiga 500, the desire to produce his own sound started to grow within. In the beginning he experimented with Hip Hop beats, but triggered by a “The Prodigy” gig he started focusing more and more on Techno. As much as for many of his contemporaries in the nineties, the legendary “Omen” club in Frankfurt served as a source of inspiration for him. His first two records under the pseudonym “Relic” were released on the label “Triebtäter” in 2000 and 2001. 
After this he took the next step and founded his own label “Enable Recordings”, on which he presents artists like “The Advent” or Andre Walter, next to his own productions. 
Little by little, Brian got the opportunity to release on further labels as well, for instance “Punkt Music” or “Definition Records”. At the same time he produced the project “Citizen Art” together with the artist ”Cess”, and amongst others released a remix for “The Horrorist” on “Things To Come”. 
But ultimately they were his own releases that turned him into a much requested live act. In the course of his transfer to CLR Booking in 2005, his booking schedule increased from the main floor of “Nature One”, to the “Detroit Electronic Music Festival” in the States to his preliminary peak at “Spinclub” / Ibiza. Next to his well-established label “Enable Recordings”, he founded another imprint called “Sonata Music” in the beginning of 2008. Although it was planned as a digital only label, he started releasing the tracks on vinyl as well, due to the big success. 
In October 2008, the album prerelease single “Cortosis” came out, together with a remix by Chris Liebing. In November 2008, the long awaited first Studio album “Stereotype” was finally released on his all-time favorite Techno label CLR. “A stylistically versatile, entirely club oriented record with traces of Minimal, House and Dub, always true to its Techno origins.” 
When Brian is not touring as a live act, or producing new tracks and remixes, he is also working as highly successful mastering technician with clients like CLR and Cocoon Recordings.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 064 I Adam Beyer</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Adam Beyer 

Adam Beyer became dedicated to the fascinating world of rhythm early on. After playing the drums as a teenager his obsession turned to the decks. In 1990 he bought his first set of turntables and started spinning a wide range of hiphop, hiphouse, acid and techno at local parties and clubs. Beyer soon learned how to blend his sets in a thoughtfull and highly focused way, a talent that has now developed into his trademark style. In 92 Fellow school friend Peter Benisch introduced Beyer to the sampler , a year later they got their first record deal with New York based Direct Drive. After finishing school in 1995, Beyer started work at the Planet Rhythm record store while releasing some tracks under a variety of names and continually djing all over Scandinavia. Adam Beyer sites Drumcodes 1 (Planet Rhythm 1995) as the first record to define his style; hard, percussive and loop oriented. This 12" names Beyer´s future label and was soon followed by his critically acclaimed debut album Decoded (Planet Rhythm 1996). His need to create the perfect dj tool gave rise to the launch of the Drumcode label allowing him total musical freedom. The label´s strong concept and high production levels meant it enjoyed immediate success. After six releases Beyer launched his second label Code Red focusing on a slightly softer side of techno. Code Red finished with its 10 th and final release Stand Down (Code Red 1999) which was a compilation of remixes from various international artists. His production skills soon brought Beyer to the attention of djs worldwide and global bookings soon followed. His meteoric rise has been cited as one of the catalysts for Swedish techno´s current influence. He pinpoints the Stockholm sound as being closely linked to his network of friends in the city aswell as the triumvirate of himself, Joel Mull and Cari Lekebusch. After many releases and remixes on various labels he launched the second album Protechtion (Drumcode 1999). While the market was being flooded with monoton loop oriented techno Beyer worked on strengthening the arrangements that characterised his earlier works, aswell as adding melodic strings. Still with a clear focus on the dance floor. The same year Adam Beyer and Cari Lekebusch linked up to create a stunning live act first witnessed in London to instant acclaim. The act created the intense feeling of a creative dj set while the duo played back to back mixing their production styles.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 062 I Speedy J.</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Speedy J.

Jochem Paap (the Rotterdam artist owes the nickname Speedy J to his DJ skills) is unanimously considered to be one of the first techno producers to come from the Benelux. Together with people like Laurent Garnier, Aphex Twin and Richie Hawtin he helped raising the genre just after it had escaped the Detroit delivery room. Since the early nineties, Speedy J releases on labels like Plus 8, Warp and Novamute. After fifteen years of techno Speedy J now has come full circle. Blurring the lines between Live performance and Digital Djing, he fuses subversive electronics and peak time Techno. Together with his partner in crime Chris Liebing he started using Traktor and other Software technology on 4 laptops with hardware such as Machine Drum and 303’s to create a fully integrated set. 
His latest projects span the audio-visual pioneer work of Umfeld, his label Electric Deluxe, his Event Series Electric Deluxe presents and his upcoming Album Project Open Collabs. Speedy J’s musical vision is genre blurring, creative freedom at the highest level of innovation and quality, it is providing a platform for artists operating within any conceivable genre in the broad spectrum of techno to fully explore and embrace the ever-expanding technological possibilities.

            <description><![CDATA[Monoloc 

Monoloc started to produce his first Sounds in 2001. A few years later he moved to a proper studio to ziro in on his music productions. The new place and his inspiring studio neighbors created a perfect environment so that he was able to upgrade his skills increasingly. He released already on labels like CLR, Synewave, MultiVitamins, Micro.fon and Droid for example who get thrilled by his deep techno sound consists of organic and sometimes dark vocal elements. 
His keen sense for good sound let him always know how to produce tracks with his special personal touch or how to create a great ambiance for the dancefloor .

Artists like Maetrik ,Alexi Delano, Elon , Ascion , Kane Roth, Mike Wall, Jan Hendez, Ion Ludwig, Brian Sanhaji, Emerson, Matt Star, Jon Seber and many more had released on his emerging label yet. Also in 2008 he got to know the people from CLR who are also impressed of his independent and unpredictable sound. They booked him for events like Nature One, Rave on Snow, Day & Night Festival, Ruhr in Love and for some well known Clubs in Germany like Fusion or Butan.

            <itunes:summary>Monoloc 

Monoloc started to produce his first Sounds in 2001. A few years later he moved to a proper studio to ziro in on his music productions. The new place and his inspiring studio neighbors created a perfect environment so that he was able to upgrade his skills increasingly. He released already on labels like CLR, Synewave, MultiVitamins, Micro.fon and Droid for example who get thrilled by his deep techno sound consists of organic and sometimes dark vocal elements. 
His keen sense for good sound let him always know how to produce tracks with his special personal touch or how to create a great ambiance for the dancefloor .
Midyear 2008 Monoloc was ready to take it to the next level and founded his own label Smallroom Music. Artists like Maetrik ,Alexi Delano, Elon , Ascion , Kane Roth, Mike Wall, Jan Hendez, Ion Ludwig, Brian Sanhaji, Emerson, Matt Star, Jon Seber and many more had released on his emerging label yet. Also in 2008 he got to know the people from CLR who are also impressed of his independent and unpredictable sound. They booked him for events like Nature One, Rave on Snow, Day &amp; Night Festival, Ruhr in Love and for some well known Clubs in Germany like Fusion or Butan.
For 2010 he already got much requests for releases and remixes on various labels. 

Besides that he planned great releases on Smallroom Music and he is looking very forward to celebrate great partys!

            <title>CLR Podcast I 060 I Function</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Function 

Function, aka David Sumner, should be a familiar name to anyone who's been paying attention to techno in New York City for the past 15+ years. Heavily influence by the early New York rave scene (Limelight, NASA, Storm, etc), Dave dove into production with a string of releases and collaborations on Damon Wild's seminal Synewave label in the mid-90s. From the late 90s to the early 00s, Function put out many productions on his own label, Infrastructure. In the process he made a strong artistic connection with Regis and Female from the UK, and formed Portion Reform with Regis, releasing a handful of 12"s and an album on the cult, UK Midlands based imprint, Downwards. This connection remains strong to this day. In 2008, Dave moved to Berlin and began to strongly focus on the Sandwell District label, which was undoubtedly one of the breakout labels that year. The label was launched in 2002, and has only put out 15 releases since then, each one well worth owning. In 2010, the techno spotlight is shining brightly on Sumner and Sandwell. He has a residency at Berghain, and appears regularly at other huge clubs around Europe, and from all reports, his performance was the best set at the Labyrinth Festival in Japan this year. And now with Sandwell District being slated to close the main stage at Sonar this June, 2 new groundbreaking V/A Promo 12"s in the pipeline set to come out in May/June 2010, which will precede a full length Sandwell District album and 2 new collaborative projects with Jerome Sydenham for CLR and Ibadan, the future really couldn't be much brighter.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 059 I Jerome Sydenham</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Jerome Sydenham

Jerome Sydenham is one of the hottest tickets in the world of house and techno music right now. His DJ sets are nothing short of phenomenal – veering from deep, intricate, chugging techno, to jackin' tech house, into huge anthemic house moments in the classic vein. Always pursuing his love for techno – both industrial-edged thumpers and deep, soulful Detroit moments, with some melodic beauties along the way.
 
Jerome Sydenham’s illustrious music career took off in the late eighties when he joined the prestigious A&R division at Atlantic Records where he worked with the likes En Vogue, Das Efx, and breaking the vocal house group Ten City. Soon after he met emerging producer Kerri Chandler – one of his closest friends and a former collaborator, his name as a producer and DJ gradually built over the ‘90s, with his superb label Ibadan Records launched in 1995.
 
He is best known for beautiful, emotive, sunkissed deep house tracks like "Swimming Places", and his timeless collaboration with Dennis Ferrer, "Sandcastles", both on leading house imprint Defected. However he also shares Ferrer’s love for hypnotic, soulful, sexy techno – bringing undeniable warmth to an often emotionally cold genre of music. His collaborations with Get Physical’s Swedish talent Tiger Stripes - like the hugely acclaimed "Elevation" and their joyous remix of Faze Action’s classic "In The Trees" - should likewise be added to the cannon of great house music history.
 
Sydenham’s desire to push the creative envelope took him into the world of Techno with the hit “Asama”, with which he launched the German based  label Apotek Records. The year 2007 also saw the initiation of a new label collaboration, Avocado Records, established in Denmark with heavy weight producer Rune RK with the monster "Elephant".
 
Recent remixes by Sydenham include: "Angel" by Carl Craig (Planet-e), "Forming Dies" by Adam Beyer & Joel Mull (Drumcode), "Way of the Lonely Ones Pt2" by Nihad Tule (Spectrum), and "Materia" by Nic Fanciulli (Global Underground).

            <description><![CDATA[Samuli Kemppi

Samuli Kemppi is one of the key figures of finnish techno scene. Hard working producer and dj who is always breaking boundaries and delivering fresh mixture of times past and days yet to come. His influences range from Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode to Sahko Records and recent Sleeparchive releases. His sound is described as icy cold techno style, a controlled exercise in minimal techno devastation, bass-heavy jacker grooves with shivering hihats and floating athomspheres… (boomkat) Samuli is releasing his music since 2002 under different names / pseudonymes. 2008 and 2009 have been very successful years for him, with phantastic releases on Ostgut Ton, Prologue and Time To Express. This year there`s a lot of great stuff in the pipeline, for example his Dark matter EP on Mote Evolver is just released.

            <description><![CDATA[Dustin Zahn

A bad ass behind the decks, and in the studio since 1998...Dustin Zahn’s productions ended up on some bigger techno labels as well as more obscure imprints. A few words can easily describe his style: moody, tribal, dark, and hypnotic.
Along with Ian Lehman, he forged the well-received “Attack People” live performance…bringing his show across the US, to South America, and Europe as well. When he’s not on tour with his DJ sets or supercharged live pa sessions, he co-promotes some of Minneapolis’s biggest techno parties. In addition, he also manages his labels Abiotic Recordings and Enemy Records, which both receive wide support from the techno community such as Adam Beyer, Chris Liebing, Redhead, Tim Xaver, Dave Clarke, Umek and countless more.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 055 I Alex Bau</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Alex Bau

Alex Bau is a dj and producer who is widely known for breaking down barriers between several styles of today’s electronic dance music. His versatile and effective production technique has gained him a long list of releases on various renowned labels. 

There are not many djs of this type. Those are djs who believed in Techno from the first minute, djs who experienced Techno from the very beginning, djs who made Techno their own thing. Djs who found their own style, even more, who developed it over the years, djs who´s name is the expression for a specific sound. Alex Bau is one of them. Why focusing on just one style of music? Why only minimal sounds? Why only Techno? Why? If you can have it all… 

There has been a time before Techno for Alex Bau. Thousands of records in his collection, different styles, different music, for sure something that leaves its marks, no doubt about it. Still he is doing Depeche Mode-Nights from time to time, just for fun, and his activities on Techno doesn´t really suffer from that, not at all! With his 5 or even more hours sets at his first resident club the „Libella“ in his south-east-Bavarian home-area, where for example also DJ Hell started his career back in the 80ies, he achieved the reputation as somebody who is totally aware of what he is doing, totally dedicated to it and also totally loving it. He had his own radio show for over 2 years on a local radio station, still so far the only Techno show in this area. After countless gigs at local clubs, he also started to play at other places all over the planet and continues doing so.

Techno can do a lot, if you let it do so. That is the credo. His credo.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 054 I Chris Liebing</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Chris Liebing

Chris Liebing is a Techno pioneer, dj, producer, CLR podcast host, radio host and the driving force behind CLR. He has been one of the first djs who fully embraced the digital age of music. Since then he has never stopped working on his dj and production setup’s and has finally reached a point of complete satisfaction with his technical and artistic possibilities. 
After a whole decade of constant label work, Chris Liebing and his team are drawing a balance. Over the last 10 years, he and many renowned producers have released their music on CLR, turning it into a consistent and increasingly successful Techno imprint. The jubilee of this well-established label gives reason for a complete renovation of the brand, with a renewal of the corporate identity, new logo and the new web domain: www.clr.net 
The recent chapter in the labels history also gives a new meaning to the abbreviation “CLR”: “Create Learn Realize”. A decade of “creating and learning” has passed and it is time for the next step named “realization”. The goal is to “realize” the embodiment of Techno in an exceptional anniversary campaign. It will include various activities and events, for example a jubilee compilation called “10Years CLR”, which will attempt to redefine the term Techno according to the contemporary standards and technical possibilities. It will feature 10 exclusive tracks by 10 of the finest producers, Release April 2010.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 053 I Ladida</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Ladida 

As soon as the name Ladida is mentioned, everybody thinks of the first lady of Czech DJing. She is typified by her precise mixing style and dynamic electronic sound with percussive elements and organic soundscapes. At the beginning of her DJ career she concentrated above all on melodic groovy techno, whereas today she is ploughing the furrow of primarily minimal techno. 
When the first techno club opened in Prague in 1995 she was in the right place at the right time, and Linda stood behind the decks side by side with famous DJs such as Jeff Mills, Carl Cox, Westbam, Laurent Garnier, DJ Hell and others. As early as 1996 she made herself known at Mayday Germany. She was voted in Frontpage magazine in 1997 as one of the best international newcomers amongst Djs and also as DJ of the year in a poll in the Czech magazine Tripmag. In several respects 2003 was an important milestone for Linda, with her crowning appearance at Love Parade, at the Big Final Event at Siegessaule, from where her set was broadcast worldwide. After appearing in Japan in 2002 (Tokyo, Nagoya), she performed a year later in Singapore. The same year she was voted Czech female DJ of the year in a poll presented by Report magazine. During the period 2005 – 2007 she appeared on the Tomáš Hanák talk show on TV Prima, made ad campaign for Toyota and performed in Brazil, China and Australia. In 2007 Linda founded her own label Article, and debuted with the label entitled “Being Free”. Linda released a further single 4U.K. and the Ladida EP called „U can“ on Article Records and also a Kultube Rmx on Italian label Rush Recordings. In 2008 Ladida produced Intel techno stage at Creamfields centrale europe festival. During this year Ladida had  residency night @ Roxy club Prague called MINIaMALY, with guests like Dubfire, Anderson Noise or Marco Carola . In 2009 Ladida played in countries like Japan, Honduras and Brazil. Recently her resident place is SaSaZu club in Prague.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 052 I Sian</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Sian

Born in Dublin, Ireland, raised gypsy style in southern Spain and constantly moving cities, Sian chose early to drop out of normal society,make music and DJ. Adhering more to the avantgarde way of life, he stands out as a little more bohemian than the average electronic figure.. a rare, flamboyant and eccentric new talent. 
As one of the most promising upcoming acts in the techno scene today, Sian revels in his uniqueness. He has already been reworked and remixed by talent like Gui Boratto, Steve Bug, Efdemin, Minilogue or Pan-Pot and so early on in his career, has toured half the world. Rocking heaving crowds and bringing his trademark experimental DJing style to the masses via multiple outputs of explosive techno, fx and loops cut up and edited live. His tracks instantly caught the ear of everyone from Sasha, John Digweed, Carl Cox to Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos, Loco Dice or Steve Bug and have shown how a genre busting raw talent crosses over stylistic boundaries. Plus his DJing performances at international contemporary clubs and festivals in Europe, to dates in North and South America, Australia and beyond. Memorable nights at pioneering clubs like Berghain, Secretsundaze, Tripod, Weekend, Hive, Nitsa etc have seen Sians marathon DJ sets bring real voodoo to the dancefloor. 
With appearances on very select labels, his unusual DJing approach and his acclaimed output on his own techno imprint, Octopus, Sian is fast becoming recognized by peer and press alike as one to watch. From international radio like the BBC to Mags like DJMAG, IDJ, Mixmag, Raveline, XLR8, Groove, Resident Advisor etc the praise for his raw style and very exploratory label are unanimous. This young imprint is already getting praised by DJs like Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Sasha, Dubfire, Loco Dice, John Digweed, Damian Lazarus, M.A.N.D.Y. Whether conducting everlasting sweat soaked DJ sessions or creating timeless dance music, Sian is a truly diverse and original talent,at once chic and hedonistic,always intensely inventive... 

Still shaking from some huge slabs of dancefloor energy with Exercise One and Jonas Kopp remixes on his own label "Octopus", Sian has been buried in the studio remixing for Bedrock, Trapez Records and is preparing 2 new releases for Soma. He’s been all over DJing to frenzied mobs, running his own "Shake your bones" residency in Barcelona and is just about to start another USA tour. Keep your eyes peeled for some serious techno workout action with his upcoming Oubliette EP, featured in this mix, with remixes from Norman Nodge and Staffan Linzatti.

            <description><![CDATA[Matthias Tanzmann

Since 1997, Matthias has been resident-dj at Distillery (Leipzig), the most renowned club in Eastern Germany. Together with Daniel Scholz he founded Gamat 3000 and shortly afterwards released tracks on Dessous Recordings, Freude am Tanzen and fm-Musik. in 2000, he and André Quaas founded the label Moon Harbour, which would offer a premium platform for Leipzig house protagonists and for befriended international producers.
 
By 2007 he had released numerous EP’s, three mix compilations and remixed several tracks. Together with Steve Bug and Daniel Stefanik, he has produced various EP’s, drawing inspiration from the new dynamics and sounds that the collaborative process can create. behind the decks he advanced to become one of the most popular and booked german house Dj’s in the world, later securing residencies at flokati (munich) and  circoloco@dc10 (ibiza).  
 
While over the years his tracks have developed from classical deep house with a european edge, through to minimal house bordering on ambitious techno, groove and deepness were and still are the essential elements of Matthias Tanzmann’s music.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 050 I Marcel Dettmann</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Marcel Dettmann

Marcel Dettmann is one of the supporting pillars of the famous Berlin Berghain sound: Powerful, sexy and knowing in the right sense. One could also say he knows his edutainment. Since 1999 Marcel is and has been a steady fixture at both the old OstGut and the new Berghain. The classic sounds of Chicago and Detroit have had a huge influence on him, but Marcel also says that „the music and the sets have to work, should have a soul and be ignorant of boundaries. I re-invent my dj philosophy for every new set, location and night. Generally, it is very important to me to play as varied as possible sets fusing classic tracks with the contemporary ones.“  Besides his dj activities, Marcel also works at Berlin’s highly influential record store Hard Wax. The store’s excellent musical portfolio provides Dettmann with a constant inspiration for his upcoming projects. „Dawning/Dead Man Watches The Clock” on our label OstGut Ton is his first ever released record a collaboration with his DJ colleague Ben Klock. It has gotten an excellent feedback and managed to chart Groove Magazine’s Top50 at number 2.  „Music always works in a certain context at a certain time, or it doesn’t. There still are a lot of interesting, very varied artists and labels releasing loads of good stuff, be it classic or experimental.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 049 I Darko Esser</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Darko Esser

Music, work, friends and life in general is all about balance for Dutch DJ, producer and promoter Darko Esser. No suprise that his debutalbum is dedicated to that neverending quest for balance, or as the Dutch call it: ‘Balans’. Most tracks on the album have opposing titles and the atmosphere changes from dark, moody and emotional to uplifting, cheerfull and happy. 
Finding balance in contradictions is also the main reason why his activities cover such a wide range and can be completely different in character. 
From programming the electronic music-events for the legendary Dutch venue Doornroosje, Merleyn and festivals up to 15.000 capacity like Free your Mind in Arnhem to DJ-ing all over Europe back to making music in the solitude of his homestudio and selecting tracks for new releases on his Wolfskuil imprint. In 2003 he started the label Wolfskuil Records together with his good friend LL. Nowadays he runs the label by himself and activity has been increasing over the years thanks to overwhelming support from the industry and off course an increasing input of strong demos. The evergrowing Wolfskuil family ranges from young producers who release their first record to established musician like Joris Voorn, DJ Yellow, Benny Rodrigues and Paul Brtschitsch. 
As a DJ he has more then 15 years of experience in the bag and has played all over Europe in world famous clubs such as Berghain & Panoramabar, Rex, Tresor, 11, House Of God and off course his homebase Doornroosje. His sound is versatile and strongly depends on the setting and atmosphere of that particular moment. One could say that his sound is strongly settles on the crossing borders between house & techno, but don’t be surprised if he takes a sideway into broken beat, dubstep, electronics or the undiscribable.

Broom's first release came way back in 1992. Since that time, and under a number of alias, the East Londoner has built up an incredible archive of work, with releases on world renowned labels such as Mo-Wax, Warp, R&S, Soma, Ifach, Platzhirsch, Rotary Cocktail, Edit Select, Material and BPitch Control.

His recent, highly acclaimed releases and remixes for Saved, Flux, 20:20, Alchemy and Platzhirsch Schallplatten have featured in the charts and on the floors of the worlds finest, and have confirmed, without doubt that Broom is one of the most consistent producers of today.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 047 I Tony Rohr</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Tony Rohr

Tony’s lengthy journey from a College scratch DJ in Effingham, IL, to Brooklyn live artist and International superstar has been driven by his love and fascination for innovative musical ideas. His range of inspiration fuels his indefinable sound, gathering ideas through early Hip-Hop, House, Industrial and finally Techno. Channeling these expressions through his performances has earned him center stage at places like I Love Techno, Nature One, Awakenings, Tresor, Berghain, Chris Liebing’s Spinclub, Kozzmozz, Fuse, and even the closing of the famous La Real in Spain.
In 2005 Tony met Tim Xavier and Camea in Brooklyn, and they began releasing together on Clink Recordings. He has contributed to five of their releases as a solo artist, and collaboratively with Tim as the Afternoon Coffee Boys. He ignited the label’s popularity with his biggest record of 2007, Kreuzberg Krunk. Tony also works with Alexi Delano, Dietrich Schoenemann and Dave Shokh (Dirka Dirka) on numerous projects and his work has been featured on top labels such as Cocoon, Weave, Podium and Frankie Records.
2008 was set to be Tony’s biggest year with two releases on Clink, one Techno and a new side of Rohr set for this summer, a House release! With additional plans for work under the Afternoon Coffee Boys moniker, coupled with his numerous collaborative releases on other labels such as Plus 8 with Alexi Delano, Tony is placing himself in the center of the action. With the rising popularity of Live PAs, Tony’s experience, production and performance skills have set him above the rest, and he is considered to be one of the hottest techno acts coming out of America.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 046 I Audio Injection</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Audio Injection

Audio Injection aka David Flores has been hooked on electronic music since his introduction to the culture in the early 90's. By age 15 he was DJing at clubs and undergrounds around Southern California mixing all varieties of techno house and hardcore techno.

His DJ career eventually lead to music production with initial techno releases on Monoid and harder edged acid on Industrial Strength and The Third Movement. Around the same time, his close involvement with underground culture lead him to the like minded individuals of Droid Behavior. After a few collaborative releases, remixes and live sets with the Droid label head, Drumcell, David joined the resident roster of the infamous Interface warehouse series.

With releases & remixes on labels Droid Rec, 4 Track, Tora x3, Stimulus and others, Audio Injection continues to shape his own sound while releasing thumping minimal techno with a funky twist.

            <title>CLR Podcast I 045 I Perc</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Perc

Cambridge born and London based 27 year old, Ali, aka Perc, Spartak and Votion, could be accused of being a musical obsessive, with a career that takes in spells in rock and indie bands, various dj-ing residencies, soundtrack work and his final destination as a producer of some of the most innovative yet accessible dance music currently in circulation. 
Key to Perc’s recent success was the release of ‘Up’ on Kompakt in summer 2007. With its unmistakable relentless rising tone ‘Up’ lodged itself in record boxes including those of Richie Hawtin, Luciano, Chris Liebing, Misc, Slam, John Digweed, Green Velvet, Erol Alkan and Steve Lawler and refused to move. Perc’s 2nd Kompakt release ‘Headphone Heart’ showed his versatility, mixing industrial-strength percussion with a haunting flute melody, a combination that on paper should never work, but somehow Ali pulled it off with style.
In 2008 Ali has released his ‘Serious Moonlight EP’ on Chris Liebing’s CLR label and a single ‘Work Harder’ on his own Perc Trax label. Ali’s ‘Swords EP’ rounded off his 2008 releases. The EP was released by the label side of Lost Souls Promotions, a London-based collective for whom Ali is now a resident DJ. Ali also made his debut at Phil Kieran’s Kranc night in Belfast and has recently been asked to be a resident at the night. This success has made Perc an in-demand remixer and over the past few years Ali has been commissioned to remix a host of world-class names including Trentemoller, James Holden, DJ Hell, Misc, Phil Kieran, DJ Yellow, Blood & Tears, Jeff Bennett, Gary Beck and many more. His most notorious re-rubs include his driving take on Holden's own 'First Light' and his reworking of DJ Hell's 'Buttersaure' that had the cream of Europe's techno scene salivating. 
Already in 2009 Ali has released on CLR and Perc Trax and has an EP for Josh Wink’s Ovum label ready for release after the summer. Alongside these are remixes of Misstress Barbara, Ed Rush, Kyle Geiger and Max Cooper (for the infamous Traum imprint), all out now or about to be unleashed.

Tim Xavier

Behind the scenes Tim has made himself a great reputation as a mastering engineer doing mix-downs, digital and vinyl mastering for clients such as Wagon Repair, Spectral, Minus, and Clink. He has become an underground secret, a doctor of audio, and has had his hands on the output of many of our favorite artists.
As a producer Tim's sound is admired, analyzed and followed, with a personal style that is overflowing with maturity and fluent simplicity. He is a techno Beethoven, deep, dark and emotional, and lets his tracks breath by manipulating a few simple ideas in each experience.
Tim is most currently noted for his involvement as a main artist on one of the most fast-rising labels from America, Clink Recordings, and also works with Tony Rohr as the Afternoon Coffee Boys.]]></description>

            <title>CLR X-Mas Podcast 2009</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Special X-Mas Podcast Competition

As I already announced in my special X-Mas podcast of the 24th of December, I wanted to use this opportunity to showcase some of next years fat CLR releases and give you a few Christmas gifts at the same time. 
I included four (4) of the many upcoming CLR releases in this special podcast and made a little comment at the beginning of each one of them. The task of the competition is to send us the correct order of the four producers mentioned below - meaning the order in which their tracks appear in this podcast.
If you are familiar with the specific sound of those artists, you should be able to know which one of those tracks was produced by each one of them. If not, you can make a guess and still have a pretty good chance to win one of the four prices. In case nobody can figure out the correct order, the best guesses win.
The prices are:

1. One of my XONE 92 mixing desks (by Allen & Heath) It has travelled with me over the past year, looks used, but fully functional and has my signature. I even have a kind of personal relationship with it ;)
2. A collection of all my Live Mix CDs 
3. Another collection of all my Live Mix CDs 
4. A collection of some CLR vinyls from the last 10 years including some rare "Es ist Freitagaaabend" 12"s

The four (4) upcoming CLR releases included in the podcast are by the following producers:

Juan Pablo Pfirter
Traversable Wormhole
Speedy J
Monoloc

If you know or if you want to guess the right order, just put it into an e-mail and send it to: podcast@clr.net

Obviously each person can only send one single e-mail and members of the CLR team as well as their family members cannot participate in the competition.

The deadline is the 24th of January 2010.

I look forward to your e-mails and wish you good luck!

Merry Christmas and peaceful holidays,

Chris Liebing

            <title>CLR Podcast | 042 | James Ruskin</title>
            <description><![CDATA[James Ruskin

London born and based techno producer and DJ James Ruskin is one of the lights in UK techno. James Ruskin comes from a background that first put him in touch with hip hop and electro and later with the emerging Detroit techno scenes and brings a long background and deep knowledge of underground electronic music to his productions and DJing. Subsequently, Ruskin and long-time friend Richard Polson set up a studio together and, by 1996, had also launched a label, Blueprint (a sub-label, Coda, followed in 2000). Originally working together as Outline, Polson and Ruskin’s first searing interpretations of minimalism formed part of a new wave of UK techno producers alongside Birmingham’s Surgeon and Regis and London’s Oliver Ho.
James’s delivered 2 albums in the past, most recent album, last year’s ‘The Dash’ was melancholic and melodic, often understated but never lightweight, Ruskin explored with a variety of tempos and beat structures on ‘The Dash’ and It’s his best long player to date. Against this backdrop, Ruskin has re-launched Blueprint with the first release proper from his new collaborative project, O/V/R, together with Regis aka Karl O’Connor. While the duo had remixed Ruskin’s ‘Lahaine’ last year, the panning, hypnotic techno of their debut EP for the label, ‘Interior’, solidifies their working relationship. Ruskin has also been releasing under his own name on the label and plans to release material by artists outside of the original Blueprint line up as well as further album projects. With more O/V/R material being recorded and plans in place to perform the project live, James Ruskin is once again providing a unique blueprint for techno music.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 041 | Christian Smith</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Christian Smith

Born in Stockholm, the DJ/producer has spent the last decade working relentlessly to bring his amalgamation of funky house and tribal techno to a global platform. Although Swedish by birth, Christian spent much of his youth in Frankfurt, Germany, and this turn fate played an unexpected role in determining his musical tastes. 
Moving to New York in 1989, Christian discovered that, running parallel to its high profile house community, the city that never sleeps also had a thriving techno scene. After finishing high school in 1992, Christian moved to Washington DC to study international business at university and, in his spare time started DJing. He never dreamt DJing would become his career. Indeed, Christians earliest DJing experiences also played a definitive role in his future work, as he first met regular collaborator John Selway in 1993. Selway, who was playing the same rave circuit as Christian at this time was also working in New Yorks renowned Satellite Records store. By '97 he felt really inspired by DJing and the music that this prompted him to get working seriously with his label TRONIC. However, on completing his studies, Christian started to go to New York more frequently to collaborate with John Selway!  Back in Stockholm later on, Smith noticed that the demand for his tightly mixed, three decks DJing had increased and was booked to play all over Europe and beyond. Tronic was one of the first tech-house labels, music that house and techno DJs could play; Christian calls his style housey techno. 
While there's no doubt that Christians distinctive work injected a much-needed sense of funk back into techno, he made it accessible to a wider audience. His DJing is of an exceptionally high standard; Smiths willingness to travel to literally every country in the globe has been another determining factor in his ascendance. While Smiths releases ensured his bookings continued to soar, the Swedish DJ/producer identifies the release of his first major mix CD, Tronic Treatment as another turning point in his career. Weighing in at twenty eight tracks and recorded live in Australia on three decks, the smooth mix moves from funky house through to dubby, rolling tech-house, into pulsating techno. In fact, as things get faster, his selection becomes more varied. Christians profile was raised by the mix. His sense of diversity and unwillingness to adhere to one dimension is an ethic Christian believes is inherent in the worlds finest DJs. Christian was most inspired by Carl Cox and Laurent Garnier. Although both DJ’s are quite different what Christian saw in Carl was the ability to mix continuously between three turntables, and create that musical fusion.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 040 | The Advent</title>
            <description><![CDATA[The Advent

Quite an appropriate name for Cisco Ferreira, a man who has played a big part in the creation and development of Techno from the very beginning of this genre’s history. Indeed, his Techno CV is the stuff of legend. Cisco was producing Techno and performing live Techno shows years before the rest of the world had even heard of the genre.
1987 Cisco began going to clubs and learning about this new thing called Acid House, which was spreading like crazy throughout London’s underground scene, culminating in the famous "Summer of Love" in 1988, the genre’s golden period. 
He released his first track in 1988, was a pioneer of the Live PA (or Live Public Address – performing Techno live in front of an audience using electronic music gear), and, if all that wasn’t enough, he even worked as the sound engineer on some of Derrick May’s, Adonis and Fingers Inc’s recording sessions!
Around this time, a record label called, Jack Trax "One of the 1st to release Acid House, House and techno in UK" Moved in next door and began using the same studio for recording sessions, with Cisco as the engineer working with Fingers Inc, Adonis, Marshall Jefferson and Derrick May. Cisco released his first record in 1988 on Ferrari records (R&S records) Then later "Cisco Ferreira" EP on Fragile. His first big break came in 1994, when he and fellow Londonite Colin McBean (a.k.a. Mr. G) were brought on by Internal Records to help co-produce a group called Salt Tank. A record contract with Internal/FFRR soon followed, committing The Advent to 12 EP’s and 3 albums.
Today, The Advent goes on just as Cisco Ferreira. While he has had a long history with tons of accomplishments to hang his hat on, he continues to make history. The Advent is fulfilling Cisco’s vision as much as ever. He is busy touring as both a DJ and a live performer, producing for numerous labels, and running his own Techno imprint, Kombination Research.
As Cisco moves forward, striving to fulfill the ambitious goals he has set one can look back at his storied past and see how he has come full circle..

            <title>CLR Podcast | 038 | Joel Mull</title>
            <description><![CDATA[JOEL MULL 
Stockholm, Sweden. He started travelling around the globe more than a decade ago and quickly made himself well known as "the Swedish techno soul" of the electronic music world. Joel's passion for music really started in his early adolescence when he began attending a music school and spending all his time at the piano and keyboard. In the early nineties the new phenomena "Rave" caught his attention and his interest for electronic music and recording own material led to large sums of money being spent on drum machines, samplers and synthesizers. Soon the first 12" techno track was released, a collaboration between him and school friend ADAM BEYER. For over 3 years, 3 times a month, Joel was warming up, closing and playing along-side many of the important DJ's on the national and international circuit. Moving back to Stockholm in 1997 Joel had more time to focus on his productions and in early 1998 his own imprint INSIDE RECORDS was born. In the recent years Joel has focused on his DJ career more than ever which has led to a hectic touring schedule. His productions and releases are also getting more attention. 
In 2007 we saw a string of releases and collaborations from Joel with other top artists, but the most important release was of course his artist Album "The Observer" on Harthouse. He integrateded Ableton live into his DJ set and used the mixer 3D from Allen&Heath to combine the two systems. The result was fantastic. He will definitely be known as one of the few who more than rode but created the wave of electronic dance music and he will always be mentioned regarding Swedish techno! This year has been another great year for Joel.  Before this years Winter Music Conference he got asked by his friend DJ/Producer Nic Fancuilli to mix a compilation with tracks from his Label Saved Records. It got featured as cover cd with the Magazine IDJ doing a WMC Special. And 30.000 units got spread around the world.  At the moment Joel is working on a album due to be released 2010. He will also continue his residency on the Drumcode label parties that are going to go on tour next year starting in January in London at Ministry of Sound...

            <itunes:summary>JOEL MULL 
Stockholm, Sweden. He started travelling around the globe more than a decade ago and quickly made himself well known as "the Swedish techno soul" of the electronic music world. Joel's passion for music really started in his early adolescence when he began attending a music school and spending all his time at the piano and keyboard. In the early nineties the new phenomena "Rave" caught his attention and his interest for electronic music and recording own material led to large sums of money being spent on drum machines, samplers and synthesizers. Soon the first 12" techno track was released, a collaboration between him and school friend ADAM BEYER. For over 3 years, 3 times a month, Joel was warming up, closing and playing along-side many of the important DJ's on the national and international circuit. Moving back to Stockholm in 1997 Joel had more time to focus on his productions and in early 1998 his own imprint INSIDE RECORDS was born. In the recent years Joel has focused on his DJ career more than ever which has led to a hectic touring schedule. His productions and releases are also getting more attention. 
In 2007 we saw a string of releases and collaborations from Joel with other top artists, but the most important release was of course his artist Album "The Observer" on Harthouse. He integrateded Ableton live into his DJ set and used the mixer 3D from Allen&amp;Heath to combine the two systems. The result was fantastic.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 037 | Benny Rodrigues</title>
            <description><![CDATA[The CLR Podcast 037, this Monday, 9th of November 2009, with a massive set from Benny Rodrigues… Enjoy, guys!

Benny Rodrigues has infiltrated himself in the list of famous Dutch top DJs in a very short time. This Rotterdam born and raised talent with Portuguese blood understands the art of using the funk, of getting the dancing floor full and the room to its feet.     Although confessed because of its groovy/funky (deep) tech-house sound with lots of detroit, minimal and acid influences, he also knows that he has to do some work now and then and he knows how he must use that hatchet, what results in a particularly strong and delightful portion of techno which remains above everything well digestible. Besides his huge amount of dj-gigs, Benny's main focus nowadays is to produce music wich reflects his tipycal edge sound, so the rest of the world will get to know and experience where Benny Rodrigues musically stands for. With releases scheduled on Darren Emerson’s (ex-Underworld) Underwater Records and other very interesting upcoming projects he's setting himself quite a good step in the right direction!]]></description>

            <title>CLR Podcast | 036 | Ida Engberg</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Hello everybody! 
It’s monday and we wanna start the first week in november with a new CLR Podcast, this time with the swedish DJ Ida Engberg... Listen and enjoy!

27-year-old Ida Engberg started DJing hip hop and soul aged 14 after a boyfriend showed her how to mix, but she says “I had absolutely no plans on becoming a DJ, I just saw it as a new way to listen to and interact with music and I loved it!”
After several residencies in the beginning, a move to Marbella brought 8 months of club gigs, followed by a season in Ibiza which inspired Ida musically like no other place. “I had fallen deeply in love with the minimal techno sound so it was perfect at the time. At the end of the season, Ida returned to Stockholm landing a top residency at Cocktail Club, the best underground club in Stockholm. “Stockholm is a great platform for electronic music. There are so many great producers and DJs living here and people really support each other.” Although DJing is her first love, it was only a matter of time before Ida tried her hand at production. Her first effort was the massive Disco Volante - signed by John Dahlbäck to his Pickadoll label and released in 2007 with a Sebastien Leger remix it became a huge hit all over the world, featuring on compilations from Ministry of Sound, Defected in the House and Pacha Ibiza. It charted across the whole of Europe. Two more tracks have followed on Get Physical and Pickadoll plus a remix for Dada Life. She can be found playing her brand of minimal, techno and tech house in clubs all over the world every weekend, and her love of what she does is obvious to all. Playing unplanned sets allows her to respond to the crowd, she’s rocked parties and clubs. Lately she also took part in the Drumcode parties with Swedish companion Adam Beyer. 
Ida started to work with AM Only and in November and December 2009 she’s doing her second tour through the U.S. which she’s really looking forward to!

            <title>CLR Podcast | 034 | Thomas Schumacher</title>
            <description><![CDATA[This week Chris presents the CLR Podcast 034 with Thomas Schumacher... Enjoy!

From the first time he heard a DJ beat-mix acid house in 1987, Thomas Schumacher immediately knew that he wanted to be a part of dance music culture.
With a strong foundation in Detroit Techno and House, Thomas has been an active - and eclectic - producer and DJ for over 17 years, and is one of the leading players on the international DJ circuit.
His international breakthough came on legendary techno label Bush Records in 1997 with the track “When I Rock”; unique at the time for fusing Techno with a distinctive hip hop sample: In the same year Thomas was commissioned to compose the music for a staging of Shakespeare’s Hamlet at the Schauspielhaus in Bonn, and he ended the year with his first solo artist album Electric Ballroom. Mixmag hailed it “Techno’s funk packed answer to (Daft Punk’s) Homework.”
He followed this up with extensive international touring, numerous productions and remixes, and two more artist albums: Electric Avenue and Home, rated by de:Bug magazine as  “…a bloody deep masterpiece”. Soon after the release of Home, Thomas signed with Get Physical Music. The affiliation with Get Physical is set to continue in 2010 when Thomas releases his new album for the label in March.
Nowadays Thomas is a proud family man, and while he still spends plenty of his time in the arrivals and departure lounges of airports all over the world, he is honoured to travel to every corner of the globe to do his thing, and showcase the diversity that has become his trademark.

            <description><![CDATA[Chris Liebing presents the CLR Podcast 032 with Tommy Four Seven.... Listen to this massive and awesome sound!

Tommy’s been steadily building his catalogue of strong, moody and hypnotic dancefloor destroyers such as early hits on Parisian label, Kill Brique and recent recordings for Wolfskuil Records, Speedy J’s Electric Deluxe and Chris Liebing’s CLR, as well as remixes for the likes of Josh Wink and Darko Esser. His approach to music is unlike a musician. Instead, Tommy prefers to sound design, recording and sculpting elements into deep engaging atmospheres. It’s this production ethos Tommy also applies in the club, morphing from tech-house, to the darker realms of techno. “I always keep the foundations deep and hypnotic, a vibe I feel that creates more of a connection.” Giving his own contribution to techno, in 2008 Tommy launched deep techno imprint, Shooting Elvis. Gathering artists from Mark Broom to Remute, to Sebastian Roya to James Kronier, choosing to release quality rather than quantity, an attitude that has not gone unnoticed with supporters including Ben Klock, Len Faki, Joel Mull and Paco Osuna.

            <title>CLR Podcast | 031 | Drumcell</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Drumcell

Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid Behavior, Drumcell has been one of techno's greatest allies in Southern California in recent times.

Founder of Droid Recordings and co-founder of Droid Behavior, Drumcell has been one of techno's greatest allies in Southern California in recent times. Associating with the members of Acid Circus to form Droid Behavior as an event production group and record label was the next logical step to raise awareness for techno in the city and to help expose local Artists, established djs, and performers from around the country. Over the last 5 years Drumcell has rocked parties from big to small on a weekly basis in LA as well as gigs all over the U.S. and has also released quite a few heavy trax on labels omniscient, remains, heavy Industries, and his own DROID Recordings imprint.

            <description><![CDATA[DJ Emerson...

...from the beginning it has been emersons motto not to rest on his laurels and to always keep his ears to the street. Putting on music, he would not simply stay with breakbeat but instead he discovered techno and later-on the slower house adapted variants of electronic dance music. This great mixture of sounds still distinguishes emerson's funky and modern style of music . Although by now Emerson got used to flying from one big city to another, he still likes it best to put on music in berlin after all. here he just feels most comfortable, deeming berlin his artistic home. someone who is a dj, producer and a label manager at the same time does not simply make music, his life is music. he does not want to be the centre of attention, who – with much boasting – boosts his   own ego. As such, he actually still remains to be more of a fan than a professionally calculating artist. 
Someone, who loves and lives music and who wants to make other people dance – it all comes down to simply being a datajockey. by now, emerson has released two own artist albums, currently working on the third one, two mix cds (boy got bass 3 has just been reocrded) and over 30 vinyl maxis and various remixes. in addition, he composed an own soundtrack for the hustler porn dj groupie the movie and on and on it goes…

            <description><![CDATA[Dubfire

Dubfire’s “jet-black, polished-chrome techno” of 2009 harnesses three and a half years of upward momentum, highlighted by notable productions and remixes landing at the top of "best of" charts and set lists the world over
After 15 ground-breaking years topping charts, winning Grammys, and earning acclaim as one-half of legendary electronic partnership Deep Dish—Dubfire returned to his roots: a diverse foundation spanning punk, industrial/new wave, jazz, dub, hip-hop, house and techno. As Dubfire's productions delved into techno's moodier, sonically-edgier dimensions, critics and fans alike celebrated the new direction with admiration and enthusiasm. His productions and remixes garnered massive popularity - 8 are listed on Beatport’s "Best of DJ Charts, 2009". 
Amongst his contemporaries, Dubfire remains a unique DJ, producer, and remixer-eager to hone and further evolve his signature sound. With an unmatched hunger to conquer the latest frontiers in electronic dance music and its rapidly changing technology, Dubfire delivers the unexpected and has no intention of slowing down.
I try to apply a punk ethic to my own music...it has to be groundbreaking, futuristic, unique and organic."]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast | 026 | Speedy J. live from "BE" at Space, Ibiza

Jochem Paap (the Rotterdam artist owes the nickname Speedy J to his DJ skills) is unanimously considered to be one of the first techno producers to come from the Benelux. Together with people like Laurent Garnier, Aphex Twin and Richie Hawtin he helped raising the genre just after it had escaped the Detroit delivery room. Since the early nineties, Speedy J releases on labels like Plus 8, Warp and Novamute After fifteen years of techno Speedy J now has come full circle. Blurring the lines between Live performance and Digital Djing, he fuses subversive electronics and peak time Techno. Together with his partner in crime Chris Liebing he started using Traktor and other Software technology on 4 laptops with hardware such as Machine Drum and 303’s to create a fully integrated set. Not only setting the bar for peak hour Techno madness, Electric Deluxe becomes the platform for his Collabs series that started on Novamute, as well as releases by open minded artists like Chris Liebing, George Issakidis, Tommy Four Seven and Terrence Fixmer to showcase the value of creative synergy using newest technology. Speedy J’s musical vision is genre blurring, creative freedom at the highest level of innovation and quality, it is providing a platform for artists operating within any conceivable genre in the broad spectrum of techno to fully explore and embrace the ever-expanding technological possibilities.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast | 024 | Oliver Huntemann live from "BE" at Space, Ibiza

05. Lee van Dowski & Anja Schneider - La Roulette

11. Pan-Pot - Confronted
12. Dubfire & Oliver Huntemann - Fuego

Hamburg-based recording artist and DJ Oliver Huntemann is, without doubt, one of the few activists from the early days still holding the torch. When acid house took Germany by storm in the late eighties, Oliver immediately knew that this was his thing - he was electrified! Through a trillion records and a wealth of projects - from the foundation of the successful dance labels Confused and Dance Electric to Huntemann and H-Man releases, via the highly profilic concept series Rekorder with Stephan Bodzin on labels like Cocoon, Gigolo or Giant Wheel, not forgetting those on his own labels and, last but not least, building the Super 8 Studio - Oliver Huntemann has yet to grow tired of serving up state of the art music! His instinctive awareness that, in terms of styles and influences, electronic dance music is - and always will be - about renewal, has allowed him to maintain a unique freshness and keep his special touch very much alive. His latest coup is a new label: Ideal. Ideal is totally dedicated to fresh electronic music, primarily in the form of his own productions. Releasing tracks as Oliver Huntemann is a perfect reflection of his personal approach to the label. Following remixes for some of the biggest names in electronic music such as Depeche Mode, Underworld, Chemical Brothers and a successful collaboration with Dubfire (Deep Dish), Oliver is still one of the hottest producers on the scene.]]></description>

Hamburg-based recording artist and DJ Oliver Huntemann is, without doubt, one of the few activists from the early days still holding the torch. When acid house took Germany by storm in the late eighties, Oliver immediately knew that this was his thing - he was electrified! Through a trillion records and a wealth of projects - from the foundation of the successful dance labels Confused and Dance Electric to Huntemann and H-Man releases, via the highly profilic concept series Rekorder with Stephan Bodzin on labels like Cocoon, Gigolo or Giant Wheel, not forgetting those on his own labels and, last but not least, building the Super 8 Studio - Oliver Huntemann has yet to grow tired of serving up state of the art music! His instinctive awareness that, in terms of styles and influences, electronic dance music is - and always will be - about renewal, has allowed him to maintain a unique freshness and keep his special touch very much alive. His latest coup is a new label: Ideal. Ideal is totally dedicated to fresh electronic music, primarily in the form of his own productions. Releasing tracks as Oliver Huntemann is a perfect reflection of his personal approach to the label. Following remixes for some of the biggest names in electronic music such as Depeche Mode, Underworld, Chemical Brothers and a successful collaboration with Dubfire (Deep Dish), Oliver is still one of the hottest producers on the scene.</itunes:summary>

            <title>CLR Podcast | 023 | Mathew Jonson live from "BE" at Space, Ibiza</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Canada’s Mathew Jonson has become one of the preeminent producers and dj’s in electronic music today. Recording on internationally renowned labels such as Sub Static, Minus, Perlon, Kompakt, Itiswhatitis, Arbutus, and now on his newly formed label Wagon Repair, Jonson has created some of the most influential tracks of the past few years. Tracks such as ‘Decompression’, ‘Alpine Rocket’ w/ Luciano, ‘Marionette’, ‘Folding Space, ‘Typerope’, and ‘Return of the Zombie Bikers’ have found themselves on the top ten lists of artists such as Gilles Peterson, Richie Hawtin, Tiga, Sven Vath and Laurent Garnier as well as magazines such as URB, FACT, DJ, GO, Raveline, Trax and Groove, where he also received accolades as ‘Best Producer of 2004’ and Best Producer 2006. Mathew’s music is a hybrid of styles; forging influences from techno, jazz, house, drum ‘n’ bass and fusion to create flowing bass lines and synth melodies that have influenced his trademark tech-fusion sound. With appearances on mix albums from Carl Craig, Daniel Bell, Adam Beyer and Ricardo Villalobos, and remixes for everyone from the Chemical Brothers and Moby to Nelly Furtado, Jonson has developed a large and varied following internationally. Mathew’s modesty continues to speak through the meditative sounds created in his studio, a testament both to his musicianship and his authentic nature.]]></description>

After being influenced by mix-tapes of artists such as Richie Hawtin, Dustin began writing music purely for fun. Shortly after, Dustin met future-partner Ian Lehman, who was established in the mid-west rave scene. Ian explained to him that music similar to his was played at parties called raves. Ian invited him to one of his shows and Dustin took his offer to see what he was talking about. After being exposed to just one party, Dustin knew this was his future. Dustin started doing a Live PA at various local parties and quickly became a favorite. After a year, Dustin stepped up to the decks and won just as much respect as he did with his productions. In early 2001, Dustin and Ian both agreed to take things to the next level. They put a halt on bookings and concentrated on the studio. A year later their work had emerged onto vinyl and all over the internet, creating a serious buzz. Abiotic was born, and the duo formed The Attack People.
 A few words can easily describe Dustin Zahn's style: moody, tribal, dark, and hypnotic. Since Dustin co-founded Abiotic Recordings with Ian Lehman in 2001, he's finished projects for labels such as Livewire Records (Detroit), Analytic Trail (Italy) and Invasion (Belgium). His tracks have been received support from techno producers such as Redhead, Adam Beyer, Danilo Vigorito, Tim Xavier, Ben Sims, Chris Liebing, Dave Clarke, Umek, and countless more. Together with partner Ian Lehman, they perform a Live PA under the moniker "The Attack People" which fuses tribalism and just plain twisted beats. Dustin is known for his diverse 3-table sets and smooth mixing through all styles of techno. ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast | 021 | Alex Bau

01. Alex Bau - "Shakalak (Shake the Disease Mix)" (Sino)
02. Kaiserdisco - "Espandrillo" (MBF)
03. Kapuchon & Benny Rodriguez - "The Finger (Radio Slave Remix)" (Spinclub)
04. D-Nox & Beckers - "Cala a Boca" (Sprout)
05. Pfirter - "Mi Auto" (Stockholm Ltd)
06. Side B - "Corn Panic" (unrel.)
07. Umek - "Destructibel Environment" (Sixteenofive)
08. Secret Cinema - "Timeless Altitude 2009" (unrel.)
09. Alex Bau - "End of the Bleep (never coming out Chordmix)"
10. Secret Cinema - "Reaktivator" (unrel.)
11. Loop from Kraftwerk`s "Tour de France Etape 2"
12. Pig & Dan - "Heat" (Yoshitoshi)
13. Loop from Radio Slave`s Grindhouse Tool`s Danton Eprom Remix
14. Edit Select - "Consumed (Edit Select Remix)" (Edit Select)
15. Dusty Kid - "Train No. 2" (Boxer)

What could you say about a guy, being "on board" for more than 10 years, travelling around half of the world with his sound and who is about to break up barriers between minimal, technotic sounds and straight techno? Words can not equal the experience you can make when you meet alex in the mood for "clubbing". Crunchy, bleeping sounds, half an hour later you can not be sure to be safe from stright techno and finally he`s playing some even trancy tunes, and the only comment you can get from him is: "Why not, if it fits?" Every single mix sounds incredibly tight, an absolutely precise feeling for the next best possible record for the moment is his trademark. Like a maniac he is controlling the dancefloor, cooking it up and finally giving it the relief by giving it the chance to explode. His very versatile productions for his own label Toneman but also for world-famous labels like Zenit, Ante Zenit, Chris Liebing`s CLR and many more exactly show what he is all about: Fighting purism, combining styles, showing that one artist can have different faces and even being able to combine them without loosing credibility. Why? Because it`s fun. For the artist, for the dancefloor. Why focussing on "Minimal", "Techhouse" or "Techno" if you can have all?]]></description>

Blurring the lines between Live performance and Digital Djing, he fuses subversive electronics and peak time Techno.

            <description><![CDATA[CLR Podcast | 019 | A. Mochi | Playlist

A.Mochi is one of the most prolific producers, Live performers and DJs in Tokyo's Techno scene. As a producer he released his music with labels like Len Faki's Figure, Francois K's WaveTec or Luke Slater's Mote-Evolver. Initially Rock music captured his attentions as a younger man, however, the impact of the heavy, fat bass and beats of electro music changed his musical life forever, which became the basis of his career today. In 2007, after releases on labels like 'Highland', 'Hardsignal' and 'Tremors' gathered him some respect, he signed a release with 'Mote-Evolver' owned by the UK's legendary techno pioneer Luke Slater. In October last year, 'Battery EP' which was released on Figure, the label owned by resident of one of the world’s most famous clubs (Berlin's Berghain / Panoramabar), Len Faki. 2009 see a further release on Figure, (Figure 19) and his work as a Remixer of Shin Nishimura in May for the label 'SCI+TEC Digital Audio', the label of Dubfire aka Deep Dish. His profound work finds wide acceptance by popular artists like Len Faki, Luke Slater, Francois K., Chris Liebing, Dave Clarke, Adam Beyer, Dubfire, TomCraft to name a few. By launching his very own label 'Resound Records' in 2007, he has started this as a platform to build connections with other Japanese artists, and support the thriving local scene with even more new music. As a producer and artist, A.Mochi will certainly bring even more sophisticated, powerful music to his audience in the year to come.

A.Mochi is one of the most prolific producers, Live performers and DJs in Tokyo's Techno scene. As a producer he released his music with labels like Len Faki's Figure, Francois K's WaveTec or Luke Slater's Mote-Evolver. Initially Rock music captured his attentions as a younger man, however, the impact of the heavy, fat bass and beats of electro music changed his musical life forever, which became the basis of his career today. In 2007, after releases on labels like 'Highland', 'Hardsignal' and 'Tremors' gathered him some respect, he signed a release with 'Mote-Evolver' owned by the UK's legendary techno pioneer Luke Slater. In October last year, 'Battery EP' which was released on Figure, the label owned by resident of one of the world’s most famous clubs (Berlin's Berghain / Panoramabar), Len Faki. 2009 see a further release on Figure, (Figure 19) and his work as a Remixer of Shin Nishimura in May for the label 'SCI+TEC Digital Audio', the label of Dubfire aka Deep Dish. His profound work finds wide acceptance by popular artists like Len Faki, Luke Slater, Francois K., Chris Liebing, Dave Clarke, Adam Beyer, Dubfire, TomCraft to name a few. By launching his very own label 'Resound Records' in 2007, he has started this as a platform to build connections with other Japanese artists, and support the thriving local scene with even more new music. As a producer and artist, A.Mochi will certainly bring even more sophisticated, powerful music to his audience in the year to come.

            <title>CLR Videocast | 001 | Netherland Tour 2009</title>
            <description><![CDATA[CLR Videocast Netherland Tour 26.02.09 - 28.02.09
At the end of February 2009, Chris Liebing played three gigs in small but renowned Techno clubs in Netherland. After the first night at the “Huize Maas” in Groningen, Brian Sanhaji who is currently touring with his new album "Stereotype" joined him for the second show in Amsterdam. The best sound system in town, a packed club and two most flowing CLR artists were the ideal conditions for an unforgettable night at the “Studio 80”. The last gig in the “Doornroosje” in Nijmegen had been sold out weeks before and Chris and Brian truely enjoyed this feast of friends. There is footage of Chris Liebing playing the latest CLR releases and the upcoming CLR26 by Perc. Brian Sanhaji plays a mesmerizing live set and the spectator gets a good insight into the life on the road. We follow Chris to the Rossini Suite in Nijmegen and learn that even experienced djs sometimes have difficulties remembering the name of the club where they are supposed to play. The camera technique during the interviews might appear unorthodox or artistic, but that´s just part of the document… The monthly videocasts are not about perfection but about transmitting a little bit of the day to day life of Chris and the CLR artists. This one in particular is all about throwing a glance on three memorable days on the road in Netherland. Chris Liebing and his team enjoyed the making of this CLR videocast and are looking forward to presenting you the next one next month.]]></description>
